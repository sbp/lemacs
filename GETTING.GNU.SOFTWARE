* GNU and the Free Software Foundation

Project GNU is organized as part of the Free Software Foundation, Inc.
The Free Software Foundation has the following goals:
  1) to create GNU as a full development/operating system.
  2) to distribute GNU and other useful software with source code and
permission to copy and redistribute.

Further information on the rationale for GNU is in file
/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/GNU (All files referred to are on the Internet host
prep.ai.mit.edu.

Information on GNU Internet mailing lists and gnUSENET newsgroupscan
be found in file /pub/gnu/GNUinfo/MAILINGLISTS.

* How To Get The Software

The easiest way to get a copy of the distribution is from someone else
who has it.  You need not ask for permission to do so, or tell any one
else; just copy it.  The second easiest is to ftp it over the
Internet.  The third easiest way is to uucp it.  Ftp and uucp
information is in file /pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP.

If you cannot get a copy any of these ways, or if you would feel more
confident getting copies straight from us, or if you would like to get
some funds to us to help in our efforts, you can order one from the
Free Software Foundation.  See file /pub/gnu/GNUinfo/DISTRIB.

* Available Software
