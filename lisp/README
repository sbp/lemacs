This directory contains source code for the Emacs facilities written
in Emacs Lisp.  *.el files are Elisp source, and *.elc files are
byte-compiled versions of the corresponding *.el files.  Byte-compiled
files are architecture-independent.  

The term subdirectory contains files of elisp that customize Emacs for
certain terminal types.  When Emacs starts, it checks the TERM
environment variable to see what type of terminal the user is running
on, checks for an elisp file named "term/${TERM}.el", and if one
exists, loads it.

When emacs starts up, it adds subdirectories of this directory to the
load-path.  The distributed directories are:

	calendar	an calendar and appointment manager
	dired		the directory editor
	gnus		an NNTP-based newsreader; version 3.13
	ilisp		inferior lisp interaction package
	term		the terminal-specific customization files
	vm		View Mail, an alternative to RMAIL
