;; LISPDIR ENTRY for the Elisp Archive ===============================
;;    LCD Archive Entry:
;;    gmhist|Sebastian Kremer|sk@thp.uni-koeln.de
;;    |Generic minibuffer history package.
;;    |$Date: 92/03/01 14:33:58 $|$Revision: 4.25 $|

;; INSTALLATION ======================================================
;; 
;; Put this file into your load-path and the following in your
;; ~/.emacs:
;; 
;;   (autoload 'read-with-history-in "gmhist")
;;   (autoload 'read-file-name-with-history-in "gmhist")
;;   (autoload 'completing-read-with-history-in "gmhist")
;;   (autoload 'gmhist-make-magic "gmhist" nil t)

;; USAGE =============================================================
;; 
;;   - as an Elisp programmer: use functions read-with-history-in,
;;     completing-read-with-history-in, read-file-name-with-history-in or
;;     gmhist-interactive inside the interactive clause of your functions
;;     instead of a string specification.  See the examples at the end of
;;     the file.
;;
;;   - as an Emacs user: To provide `simple' functions with history,
;;     just type M-x gmhist-make-magic and enter the name of the
;;     function, e.g., `eval-expression'.  This function's arguments
;;     are then remembered across calls and are available by typing
;;     M-p to the minibuffer prompt of the function.  More history
;;     commands are mentioned in the documentation of variable
;;     gmhist-map.
;;
;;     Type M-x gmhist-remove-magic to restore the function's old
;;     interactive behaviour.
;;
;;     `Simple' functions are those that prompt for strings, file
;;     names or lisp objects and perhaps use prefix args and the
;;     region.  See the file gmhist-app.el for examples with simple
;;     and other functions.

;; I'd like to thank Jamie Zawinski, Piet van Oostrum and Mike
;; Williams for very helpful feedback and ideas.


(provide 'gmhist)

;; Emacs 19 has s-expr interactive's on some functions (sometimes to
;; emulate functionality gmhist would give).  So we sometimes have to
;; test this to avoid letting gmhist-make-magic bombing on non-string
;; interactive specifications:
(defvar gmhist-emacs-19-p (equal (substring emacs-version 0 2) "19"))

(defvar gmhist-default-format "[%s] "	; saves screen space, too
  "Format used by gmhist to indicate the presence of a default value.
Set this to \"(default %s) \" to get the standard format.")

(defvar gmhist-search-history nil "History of history searches.")

(defun read-with-history-in (GMHIST-SYMBOL rwhi-prompt &optional
		GMHIST-INITIAL GMHIST-READ)
  ;; We have to be careful about dynamical scoping here so as not to
  ;; shadow other lisp code that depends on fluid vars like `prompt
  ;; (notorious in minibuffer code, e.g. electric-replace).
  ;; That's why our own fluid vars have upper-case names starting with
  ;; GMHIST- and why `rwhi-prompt' instead of `prompt' is used as
  ;; formal argument.  Similar below.
  "\
Read a string, maintaining minibuffer history across calls in GMHIST-SYMBOL,
  prompting with PROMPT, with optional GMHIST-INITIAL as initial contents.
If optional fourth arg GMHIST-READ is non-nil, then interpret the
  result as a lisp object and return that object.
See variable gmhist-map for history commands available during edit.
Example:
    (defun foo-command (cmd)
      (interactive (list (read-with-history-in 'foo-history \"Foo: \" )))
      (message \"Fooing %s...\" cmd))

See function gmhist-make-magic on how to give an existing function
history.

These properties (see function put) of GMHIST-SYMBOL are supported:

cursor-end    Put cursor at end of a newly retrieved history line.
cursor-pos    A regexp to put the cursor on.
keep-dups     If t, duplicate commands are remembered, too.
initial-hist  Initial value of the history list.
hist-ignore   Regexp of commands that are not to be added to the history.
backup	      If t, backup in the history list (as if user had typed
	      M-p as first thing).  Can also be an integer to backup
	      more than one history item.
default       An empty string as input will default to the last
	      command (whether the last command was added to the
	      history or not).  The default is stored in this
	      property, thus its initial value is the first default.
dangerous     Commands matching this regexp will never be the default.
no-default    If you don't want defaults at all, set this to t.

Use the following only if you know what you are doing:

hist-function Name of a function to call instead of doing normal
              history processing.  read-with-history-in becomes
              effectively an alias for this function.

These will be flushed soon (use let-binding minibuffer-completion-table
etc. instead):

hist-map      Minibuffer key map to use instead of gmhist-map.
completion-table
completion-predicate
	      Used in completion on history strings, when the hist-map
	      property has gmhist-completion-map as value.
	      The special value `t' for the table means to use the
	      current history list.
	      Thus, to get completion on history items just do:
		(put 'foo-history 'hist-map gmhist-completion-map)
		(put 'foo-history 'completion-table t)

Hooks:
  gmhist-after-insert-hook is run after a history item is
    inserted into the minibuffer.
  gmhist-load-hook is run after this package is loaded.
  gmhist-hook is run as first thing inside read-with-history-in.
  gmhist-before-move-hook is run before history motion takes place.
    Function gmhist-remember-zero is a candidate for that hook.
"
  ;; We don't use property names prefixed with 'ghmist-' because the
  ;;   caller has freedom to use anything for GMHIST-SYMBOL.
  ;; The history list is never truncated, but I don't think this will
  ;;   cause problems.  All histories together have at most a few k.
  ;;   On the other hand, some people run an Emacs session for weeks.
  ;;   Could use gmhist-hook to truncate the current history list.
  ;; You can use 'initial-hist to save (part of) the history in a file
  ;;   and provide it at next startup.  [Is there an exit-emacs-hook?]
  ;; You can use 'hist-function to implement a completely different
  ;;   history mechanism, e.g., a ring instead of a list, without having
  ;;   to modify existing gmhist applications.
