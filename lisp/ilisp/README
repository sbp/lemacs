Note: this version of ILISP has been modified to work with Lucid GNU Emacs.

Version 4.12 of the EMACS to LISP interface ILISP is now available.
If you have gotten ILISP prior to today, you should get the new
version. 

Major changes from 4.11:

--More robust and featureful popper and completer.

--Fixed bugs in lucid and CMU CL interfaces.

--Includes the new version of completion.el.

--Lots of little bugs were stomped on.  Including one that caused
errors when interrupting the inferior LISP.

INCOMPATIBILITIES:

--None known.

FEATURES:

+Support for multiple LISP dialects including Lucid, Allegro, KCL,
AKCL, IBCL and CMU on multiple machines even at the same time.

+Dynamically sized pop-up windows that can be buried and scrolled from
any window.
