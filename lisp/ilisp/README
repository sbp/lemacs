This is version 5.5 of ILISP.  

	The fixes since 5.4 are:

-- Now works with lemacs 19.8 (to be released soon) in addition to all
   the other versions of emacs around.

Fixes in 5.4:

-- Added support for cmulisp 17b.

-- Fixed definition regexp in ilisp-locate-ilisp.   Thanks to Paul
   Krause.

-- Hacked popper to make output lines of one line or less get
   displayed in the message buffer, depending on the variable
   popper-use-message-buffer. 

Fixes in 5.3:

-- Fixes some problems in clisp.lisp

-- Makefile-ilisp now valid for Sun's distributed `make'.

-- Did the right thing regarding autoloads (yes you have to define them
in your .emacs, and make them autoload "ilisp".)  See ilisp.emacs

-- Put the run-hooks calls at the end of ilisp.el where they should be.

	"Fixes" in version 5.2 of ILISP.  

Cause more problems with autoloads and fixes a missing definition in the
Makefile-ilisp in 5.1

	"Fixes" in version 5.1:

It removes some correct information concerning autoloads in ilisp.texi
and ilisp.emacs that was released in 5.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The major changes from 4.12:

--Now works with emacs-18, fsf emacs-19, and Lucid emacs-19.

--Major file splitting done in an attempt to modularize ILISP.

--Added 'message feature for lisp-no-popper, allows output from ILISP
to be sent to the message window (instead of via the popper or the
inferior lisp buffer) if it is one line long.  Useful for small
arg-lists, etc. Now the default.  

--Made the popper be off by default.  To have the popper on, set
popper-pop-buffers and popper-buffers-to-skip to t in a
popper-load-hook. See the sample in popper.el
