(defvar diary-file "~/diary" "\
*Name of the file in which one's personal diary of dates is kept.

The file's entries are lines in any of the forms

            MONTH/DAY
            MONTH/DAY/YEAR
            MONTHNAME DAY
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR
            DAYNAME

at the beginning of the line; the remainder of the line is the diary entry
string for that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is
a number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two digits.
If the date does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year.
DAYNAME entries apply to any date on which is on that day of the week.
MONTHNAME and DAYNAME can be spelled in full, abbreviated to three
characters (with or without a period), capitalized or not.  Any of DAY,
MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be `*' which matches any day, month, or year,
respectively.

The European style (in which the day precedes the month) can be used
instead, if you execute `european-calendar' when in the calendar, or set
`european-calendar-style' to t in your .emacs file.  The European forms are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

To revert to the default American style from the European style, execute
`american-calendar' in the calendar.

A diary entry can be preceded by a diary-nonmarking-symbol (ordinarily `&')
to make that entry nonmarking--that is, it will not be marked on dates in
the calendar window but will appear in a diary window.

Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with
either a TAB or one or more spaces.

Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary
entries (in the default American style):

     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!
     &1/1. Happy New Year!
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.
     21: Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89 Friday the thirteenth!!
     &thu 4pm squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16 Dad's birthday
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.
     &* 15 time cards due.

If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line will not be displayed in the
diary window; only the continuation lines will be shown.  For example, the
single diary entry

     02/11/1989
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School

will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if
used with more than one day's entries displayed.

Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry

      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation

causes the diary entry \"Vacation\" to appear from November 1 through November
10, 1990.  Other functions available are `diary-float', `diary-anniversary',
`diary-cyclic', `day-of-year', `iso-date', `commercial-date', `french-date',
`hebrew-date', `islamic-date', `parasha', `omer', and `rosh-hodesh'.  See the
documentation for the function `list-sexp-diary-entries' for more details.

Diary entries based on the Hebrew and/or the Islamic calendar are also
possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they are ignored
unless you set the `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' and the
`nongregorian-diary-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the documentation
for these functions for details.

Diary files can contain directives to include the contents of other files; for
details, see the documentation for the variable `list-diary-entries-hook'.")

A pseudo-pattern is a list of regular expressions and the keywords `month',
`day', `year', `monthname', and `dayname'.  The keyword `monthname' will
match the name of the month, capitalized or not, or its three-letter
abbreviation, followed by a period or not; it will also match `*'.
Similarly, `dayname' will match the name of the day, capitalized or not, or
its three-letter abbreviation, followed by a period or not.  The keywords
`month', `day', and `year' will match those numerical values, preceded by
arbitrarily many zeros; they will also match `*'.

The matching of the diary entries with the date forms is done with the
standard syntax table from Fundamental mode, but with the `*' changed so
that it is a word constituent.

If, to be mutually exclusive, a pseudo-pattern must match a portion of the
diary entry itself, the first element of the pattern MUST be `backup'.  This

Islands on the fourth Monday in August, add

     (float 8 1 4 \"Hurricane Supplication Day\")

to the list (the last Monday would be specified with `-1' instead of `4').
To add the last day of Hanukah to the list, use

     (hebrew 10 2 \"Last day of Hanukah\")

since the Hebrew months are numbered with 1 starting from Nisan, while to
add the Islamic feast celebrating Mohammed's birthday use

     (islamic 3 12 \"Mohammed's Birthday\")

since the Islamic months are numbered from 1 starting with Muharram.  To
add Thomas Jefferson's birthday, April 2, 1743 (Julian), use

     (julian 4 2 \"Jefferson's Birthday\")

To include a holiday conditionally, use the if form.  For example, to
include American presidential elections, which occur on the first Tuesday
after the first Monday in November of years divisble by 4, add

     (if (zerop (% displayed-year 4))

Display a three-month calendar in another window.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in the middle
surrounded by the previous and next months.  The cursor is put on today's date.

This function is suitable for execution in a .emacs file; appropriate setting
of the variable `view-diary-entries-initially' will cause the diary entries for
the current date to be displayed in another window.  The value of the variable
`number-of-diary-entries' controls the number of days of diary entries
displayed upon initial display of the calendar.

An optional prefix argument ARG causes the calendar displayed to be ARG
months in the future if ARG is positive or in the past if ARG is negative;
in this case the cursor goes on the first day of the month.

Once in the calendar window, future or past months can be moved into view.
Arbitrary months can be displayed, or the calendar can be scrolled forward
or backward.

The cursor can be moved forward or backward by one day, one week, one month,
or one year.  All of these commands take prefix arguments which, when negative,
cause movement in the opposite direction.  For convenience, the digit keys
and the minus sign are automatically prefixes.  The window is replotted as
necessary to display the desired date.

Diary entries can be marked on the calendar or displayed in another window.

Use M-x describe-mode for details of the key bindings in the calendar window.

The Gregorian calendar is assumed.

After preparing the calendar window initially, the hooks given by the variable
`initial-calendar-window-hook' are run.

The hooks given by the variable `today-visible-calendar-hook' are run
everytime the calendar window gets scrolled, if the current date is visible
in the window.  If it is not visible, the hooks given by the variable
`today-invisible-calendar-hook' are run.  Thus, for example, setting
`today-visible-calendar-hook' to 'calendar-star-date will cause today's date
to be replaced by asterisks to highlight it whenever it is in the window." "P"])

       \\[calendar-forward-day]  one day forward           \\[calendar-backward-day]  one day backward
       \\[calendar-forward-week]  one week forward          \\[calendar-backward-week]  one week backward
       \\[calendar-forward-month]  one month forward       \\[calendar-backward-month]  one month backward
       \\[calendar-forward-year]  one year forward        \\[calendar-backward-year]  one year backward
       \\[calendar-beginning-of-week]  beginning of week         \\[calendar-end-of-week]  end of week
       \\[calendar-beginning-of-month]  beginning of month      \\[calendar-end-of-month]  end of month
       \\[calendar-beginning-of-year]  beginning of year       \\[calendar-end-of-year]  end of year
       \\[calendar-goto-date]  go to date                \\[calendar-goto-julian-date]  go to Julian date
       \\[calendar-goto-hebrew-date]  go to Hebrew date         \\[calendar-goto-islamic-date]  go to Islamic date
       \\[calendar-goto-iso-date]  go to ISO date

You can mark a date in the calendar and switch the point and mark:
       \\[calendar-set-mark]  mark date                 \\[calendar-exchange-point-and-mark]  exchange point and mark
You can determine the number of days (inclusive) between the point and mark by
       \\[calendar-count-days-region]  count days in the region

The commands for calendar movement are:

       \\[scroll-calendar-right]  scroll one month right   \\[scroll-calendar-left]  scroll one month left
       \\[scroll-calendar-right-three-months]  scroll 3 months right    \\[scroll-calendar-left-three-months]  scroll 3 months left
       \\[calendar-current-month]  display current month        \\[calendar-other-month]  display another month

Whenever it makes sense, the above commands take prefix arguments that
multiply their affect.  For convenience, the digit keys and the minus sign
are bound to digit-argument, so they need not be prefixed with ESC.

If the calendar window somehow becomes corrupted, it can be regenerated with

       \\[redraw-calendar]  redraw the calendar

The following commands deal with holidays and other notable days:

       \\[calendar-cursor-holidays]  give holidays for the date specified by the cursor
       \\[mark-calendar-holidays]  mark notable days
       \\[calendar-unmark]  unmark dates
       \\[list-calendar-holidays]  display notable days

The command M-x holidays causes the notable dates for the current month, and
the preceding and succeeding months, to be displayed, independently of the
calendar.

The following commands control the diary:

       \\[mark-diary-entries]  mark diary entries          \\[calendar-unmark]  unmark dates
       \\[view-diary-entries]  display diary entries       \\[show-all-diary-entries]  show all diary entries
       \\[print-diary-entries]  print diary entries

Displaying the diary entries causes the diary entries from the diary-file
(for the date indicated by the cursor in the calendar window) to be
displayed in another window.  This function takes an integer argument that
specifies the number of days of calendar entries to be displayed, starting
with the date indicated by the cursor.

The command \\[print-diary-entries] prints the diary buffer (as it appears)
on the line printer.

The command M-x diary causes the diary entries for the current date to be
displayed, independently of the calendar.  The number of days of entries is
governed by number-of-diary-entries.

The format of the entries in the diary file is described in the
documentation string for the variable diary-file.

When diary entries are in view in the window, they can be edited.  It is
important to keep in mind that the buffer displayed contains the entire
diary file, but with portions of it concealed from view.  This means, for
instance, that the forward-char command can put the cursor at what appears
to be the end of the line, but what is in reality the middle of some
concealed line.  BE CAREFUL WHEN EDITING THE DIARY ENTRIES! (Inserting
additional lines or adding/deleting characters in the middle of a visible
line will not cause problems; watch out for end-of-line, however--it may
put you at the end of a concealed line far from where the cursor appears to
be!)  BEFORE EDITING THE DIARY IT IS BEST TO DISPLAY THE ENTIRE FILE WITH
show-all-diary-entries.  BE SURE TO WRITE THE FILE BEFORE EXITING FROM THE
CALENDAR.

The following commands assist in making diary entries:

       \\[insert-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the selected date
       \\[insert-weekly-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the selected day of the week
       \\[insert-monthly-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the selected day of the month
       \\[insert-yearly-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the selected day of the year
       \\[insert-block-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the block days between point and mark
       \\[insert-anniversary-diary-entry]  insert an anniversary diary entry for the selected date
       \\[insert-cyclic-diary-entry]  insert a cyclic diary entry

There are corresponding commands to assist in making Hebrew- or Islamic-date
diary entries:

       \\[insert-hebrew-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the Hebrew date corresponding
                to the selected date
       \\[insert-monthly-hebrew-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the day of the Hebrew month
                corresponding to the selected day
       \\[insert-yearly-hebrew-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the day of the Hebrew year
                corresponding to the selected day
       \\[insert-islamic-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the Islamic date corresponding
                to the selected date
       \\[insert-monthly-islamic-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the day of the Islamic month
                corresponding to the selected day
       \\[insert-yearly-islamic-diary-entry]  insert a diary entry for the day of the Islamic year
                corresponding to the selected day

All of the diary entry commands make nonmarking entries when given a prefix
argument; with no prefix argument, the diary entries are marking.

The day number in the year and the number of days remaining in the year can be
determined by

       \\[cursor-to-calendar-day-of-year]  show day number and the number of days remaining in the year

Equivalent dates on the ISO commercial, Julian, Hebrew, Islamic and French
Revolutionary calendars can be determined by

       \\[cursor-to-iso-calendar-date]  show equivalent date on the ISO commercial calendar
       \\[cursor-to-julian-calendar-date]  show equivalent date on the Julian calendar
       \\[cursor-to-hebrew-calendar-date]  show equivalent date on the Hebrew calendar
       \\[cursor-to-islamic-calendar-date]  show equivalent date on the Islamic calendar
       \\[cursor-to-french-calendar-date]  show equivalent date on the French Revolutionary calendar

To exit from the calendar use

       \\[exit-calendar]  exit from calendar

The variable `view-diary-entries-initially', whose default is nil, can be
set to to t cause diary entries for the current date will be displayed in
another window when the calendar is first displayed, if the current date is
visible.  The variable `number-of-diary-entries' controls number of days of
diary entries that will be displayed initially or with the command M-x
diary.  For example, if the default value 1 is used, then only the current
day's diary entries will be displayed.  If the value 2 is used, both the
current day's and the next day's entries will be displayed.  The value can
also be a vector: If the value is [0 2 2 2 2 4 1] then no diary entries
will be displayed on Sunday, the current date's and the next day's diary
entries will be displayed Monday through Thursday, Friday through Monday's
entries will be displayed on Friday, while on Saturday only that day's
entries will be displayed.

The variable `view-calendar-holidays-initially' can be set to t to cause
the holidays for the current three month period will be displayed on entry
to the calendar.  The holidays are displayed in another window.

The variable `mark-diary-entries-in-calendar' can be set to t to cause any
dates visible with calendar entries to be marked with the symbol specified
by the variable `diary-entry-marker', normally a plus sign.

The variable `initial-calendar-window-hook', whose default value is nil,
is list of functions to be called when the calendar window is first opened.
The functions invoked are called after the calendar window is opened, but
once opened is never called again.  Leaving the calendar with the `q' command
and reentering it will cause these functions to be called again.

The variable `today-visible-calendar-hook', whose default value is nil,
is the list of functions called after the calendar buffer has been prepared
with the calendar when the current date is visible in the window.
This can be used, for example, to replace today's date with asterisks; a
function calendar-star-date is included for this purpose:
    (setq today-visible-calendar-hook 'calendar-star-date)
It could also be used to mark the current date with `*'; a function is also
provided for this:
    (setq today-visible-calendar-hook 'calendar-mark-today)

The variable `today-invisible-calendar-hook', whose default value is nil,
is the list of functions called after the calendar buffer has been prepared
with the calendar when the current date is not visible in the window.

The variable `list-diary-entries-hook' is the list of functions called
after the diary buffer is prepared.  The default value simply displays the
diary file using selective-display to conceal irrelevant diary entries.  An
alternative function `prepare-fancy-diary-buffer' is provided that, when
used as the `list-diary-entries-hook', causes a noneditable buffer to be
prepared with a neatly organized day-by-day listing of relevant diary
entries, together with any known holidays.  The inclusion of the holidays
slows this fancy display of the diary; to speed it up, set the variable
`holidays-in-diary-buffer' to nil.

The variable `print-diary-entries-hook' is the list of functions called
after a temporary buffer is prepared with the diary entries currently
visible in the diary buffer.  The default value of this hook adds a heading
(composed from the diary buffer's mode line), does the printing with the
command lpr-buffer, and kills the temporary buffer.  Other uses might
include, for example, rearranging the lines into order by day and time.
