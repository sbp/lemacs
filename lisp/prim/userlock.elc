This function has a choice of three things to do:
  do (signal 'buffer-file-locked (list FILE USER))

  return nil (edit the file even though it is locked).

Ask a user who is about to modify an obsolete buffer what to do.
This function has two choices: it can return, in which case the modification
of the buffer will proceed, or it can (signal 'file-supersession (file)),
in which case the proposed buffer modification will not be made.

The buffer in question is current when this function is called."])
