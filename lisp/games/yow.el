;;; Commentary:

;; Important pinheadery for GNU Emacs.
;;
;; See cookie1.el for implementation.  Note --- the `n' argument of yow
;; from the 18.xx implementation is no longer; we only support *random*
;; random access now.

;;; Code:

(require 'cookie1)

(defvar yow-file (concat data-directory "yow.lines")
   "Pertinent pinhead phrases.")

;;;###autoload
(defun yow (&optional interactive)
  "Return or display a random Zippy quotation."
  (interactive "p")
  (let ((yow (cookie
	      yow-file
              "Am I CONSING yet?..." "I have SEEN the CONSING!!")))
    (cond ((not interactive)
	   yow)
