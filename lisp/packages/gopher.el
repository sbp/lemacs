;; An emacs gopher client.  Currently supports directory, text, CSO,
;; index, image, and telnet objects.
;; Requires forms.el and background.el.
;; 
;; Written by scott snyder <snyder@fnald0.fnal.gov>
;; Some code borrowed from GNUS (by Masanobu UMEDA).
;; Some code (bookmarks, xterms, error handling) contributed
;; by Stewart Clamen <clamen@cs.cmu.edu>.

;;; Commentary:
;; OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
;;
;; To use, `M-x gopher'.  To specify a different root server, use
;; `C-u M-x gopher'.  If you want to use bookmarks, set the variable
;; gopher-support-bookmarks appropriately.
;; The command `M-x gopher-atpoint' will attempt to interpret the text
;; around point as a gopher bookmark specification and will retrieve
;; that item.
;;
;; Sample .emacs configuration:
;;  (autoload 'gopher "gopher")
;;  (autoload 'gopher-atpoint "gopher")
;;  (setq gopher-support-bookmarks t)
;;
;; In directory mode:
;;   Space, return, `f', or `e' selects the line point is on.
;;   With a numeric prefix argument, select that object.
;;   `q', `l', or `u' will return to the previous node.
;;   `n' and `p' to the next and previous lines.
;;   `a' will add an object to your bookmark list.
;;   `v' will display your bookmark list.
;;   `=' gives detailed information about an object.
;;  In the bookmark list, all of the above (except `a'), plus:
;;   `C-k' will delete an object from the bookmark list.
;;   `C-y' will yank the most recently deleted bookmark object back into
;;         the bookmark buffer.
;;   `s' will save the bookmark list.
;;   `Q' will quit gopher entirely, killing all gopher buffers.
;;
;;   All commands which operate on a specific object can take an optional
;;   numeric prefix argument giving the index of the object on which
;;   to operate.
;;
;; In document mode:
;;   Space pages forward.
;;   Delete pages backward.
;;   `q', `l' or `u' returns to the last node.
;;
;; In the CSO entry form:
;;    `C-c RET' performs a look-up, based on the field contents
;;      you've filed in.
;;    `C-c l' returns to the previous node.
;;
;; Telnets:
;;    If you have an X server set, gopher will try to create an xterm
;;    running telnet.  If not, the emacs-lisp telnet mode will be used.
;;    From the emacs-lisp telnet mode, use `C-c l' to kill the session
;;    and return to the previous node.
;;    See also the variable gopher-telnet-command.
;;
;; Images:
;;    Images are displayed using the command gopher-image-display-command.
;;    The default setting for this variable uses xv.
;;
;; Note:
;;   If gopher consistently hangs while trying to retrieve an object,
;;   try turning on gopher-buggy-accept (which see).
;;
;; VMS notes:
;;   To use this on VMS, you'll need my emacs subprocess patches (recently
;;   posted on gnu.emacs.sources; if you can't find them, send me mail).
;;   To be able to run telnet in a separate decterm, you'll also need
;;   to (setq shell-file-name "docmd") and create the file
;;   emacs_library:[etc]docmd.com containing the following:
;;     $ if p1 .eqs. "-C" then p1 = ""
;;     $ deass sys$input
;;     $ 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
;;     $ eoj

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; Version 1.03    30-APR-1993
;;  * Add a buffer-local variable gopher-obj to all gopher buffers bound
;;    to the description of the object contained in that buffer.
;;
;; Version 1.02    20-APR-1993 
;;  * Avoid using replace-regexp in gopher-clean-text.  (Suggested by
;;    sbyrnes@rice.edu (Steven Byrnes)).
;;  * Added gopher-port-aliases.
;;  * Print ports as strings in gopher-directory-show-object.
;;  * Don't (ding) when the net stream closes unexpectedly.
;;  * Added image display (based on code from beldar@MicroUnity.com
;;    (Gardner Cohen)).
;;  * Attempt to improve error reporting.
;;  * Reworked gopher-parse-bookmark to handle out-of-order fields.
;;  * Added gopher-atpoint.
;;  * Moved bookmark init stuff to gopher-read-bookmarks.
;;  * Added gopher-quit (based on code from Thomas L|fgren
;;    <tde9104@abacus.hgs.se>).
;;  * Change usage of background for lemacs.
;;    (Patch from "William M. Perry" <wmperry@raisin.ucs.indiana.edu>).
;;  * Added a (provide 'gopher) at end.
;;  * Added `f' and `e' bindings in directory mode.
;;    
;; Version 1.01
;;  * Added patch suggested by Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga
;;    <zuazaga@ucunix.san.uc.EDU> to allow null Path= items in .gopherrc.
;;
;; Version 1.00    29-AUG-1992
;;  * Added gopher-buggy-accept.
;;  * Reworked telnet stuff to use an arbitrary command string to start up
;;    the telnet process.  This can be used to start the telnet in a
;;    separate terminal window.
;;    Based on code from Stewart Clamen.
;;  * Stewart Clamen <clamen@cs.cmu.edu> added bookmarks.
;;  * Added 's key binding to save bookmarks.
;;  * Added a prefix argument to gopher-directory-buffer and
;;    gopher-add-bookmark.
;;  * Added standard emacs-lisp header.
;;  * Stewart Clamen <clamen@cs.cmu.edu> added some error trapping and
;;    recovery (gopher-retrieve-document-cleanly).
;;  * Appended node description to the node's buffer's name.
;;  * Reformat bookmark buffers when returning to them via gopher-last-node
;;    or when an item is deleted.
;;  * Added gopher-yank-bookmark.
;;  * Added gopher-bookmark-modified-tick to prevent reformatting bookmark
;;    buffers needlessly.
;;
;; Version 0.92    27-JUL-1992
;;  * Added gopher-hostname-aliases.
;;
;; Version 0.91    30-JUN-1992
;;  * Deal with servers which send stuff after the CR.
;;  * Prevent gopher-directory-show-object from clearing the read-only flag.
;;  * Allow specification of port number in `C-u M-x gopher'.
;;
;; Version 0.9     29-JUN-1992
;;  * Initial release.
