Diff Mode is used by \\[diff] for perusing the output from the diff program.
All normal editing commands are turned off.  Instead, these are available:

\\[scroll-up]	Scroll to next screen of this difference.
\\[scroll-down]	Scroll to previous screen of this difference.

\\[diff-previous-difference]	Move to Previous Difference.
\\[diff-show-difference]	Jump to difference specified by numeric position.
