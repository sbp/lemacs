;;; This file defines a a shell-in-a-buffer package (shell mode) built
;;; on top of comint mode.  This is actually cmushell with things
;;; renamed to replace its counterpart in Emacs 18.  cmushell is more
;;; featureful, robust, and uniform than the Emacs 18 version.

;;; Since this mode is built on top of the general command-interpreter-in-
;;; a-buffer mode (comint mode), it shares a common base functionality, 
;;; and a common set of bindings, with all modes derived from comint mode.
;;; This makes these modes easier to use.

;;; For documentation on the functionality provided by comint mode, and
;;; the hooks available for customising it, see the file comint.el.
;;; For further information on shell mode, see the comments below.

;;; Needs fixin:
;;; When sending text from a source file to a subprocess, the process-mark can 
;;; move off the window, so you can lose sight of the process interactions.
;;; Maybe I should ensure the process mark is in the window when I send
;;; text to the process? Switch selectable?

;;; SHELL.EL COMPATIBILITY
;;; Notes from when this was called cmushell, and was not the standard emacs
;;; shell package.
;;;============================================================================
;;; In brief: this package should have no trouble coexisting with shell.el.
;;; 
;;; Most customising variables -- e.g., explicit-shell-file-name -- are the
;;; same, so the users shouldn't have much trouble. Hooks have different
;;; names, however, so you can customise shell mode differently from cmushell
;;; mode. You basically just have to remember to type M-x cmushell instead of
;;; M-x shell.
;;; 
;;; It would be nice if this file was completely plug-compatible with the old
;;; shell package -- if you could just name this file shell.el, and have it
;;; transparently replace the old one. But you can't.  Several other packages
;;; (tex-mode, background, dbx, gdb, kermit, monkey, prolog, telnet) are also
;;; clients of shell mode. These packages assume detailed knowledge of shell
;;; mode internals in ways that are incompatible with cmushell mode (mostly
;;; because of cmushell mode's greater functionality).  So, unless we are
;;; willing to port all of these packages, we can't have this file be a
;;; complete replacement for shell.el -- that is, we can't name this file
;;; shell.el, and its main entry point (shell), because dbx.el will break
;;; when it loads it in and tries to use it.
;;; 
;;; There are two ways to fix this. One: rewrite these other modes to use the
;;; new package. This is a win, but can't be assumed. The other, backwards
;;; compatible route, is to make this package non-conflict with shell.el, so
;;; both files can be loaded in at the same time. And *that* is why some
;;; functions and variables have different names: (cmushell),
;;; cmushell-mode-map, that sort of thing. All the names have been carefully
;;; chosen so that shell.el and cmushell.el won't tromp on each other.

(defun shell-mode ()
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior shell.
Return after the end of the process' output sends the text from the

Return before end of process output copies the current line (except
    for the prompt) to the end of the buffer and sends it.
\\[send-invisible] reads a line of text without echoing it, and sends it to
    the shell.  This is useful for entering passwords.

If you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]

cd, pushd and popd commands given to the shell are watched by Emacs to keep
this buffer's default directory the same as the shell's working directory.

\\[shell-dirtrack-toggle] turns directory tracking on and off.

Customisation: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`shell-mode-hook' (in that order).   After each shell output, the hooks on
`comint-output-filter-functions' are run.

Variables `shell-cd-regexp', `shell-pushd-regexp' and `shell-popd-regexp'
are used to match their respective commands, while `shell-pushd-tohome',
`shell-pushd-dextract' and `shell-pushd-dunique' control the behavior of the
relevant command.

Variables `comint-completion-autolist', `comint-completion-addsuffix' and
`comint-completion-recexact' control the behavior of file name, command name
and variable name completion.  Variable `shell-completion-execonly' controls
the behavior of command name completion.

Variables `comint-input-ring-file-name' and `comint-input-autoexpand' control
the initialisation of the input ring history, and history expansion.

Variables `comint-output-filter-functions', `comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input',
and `comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output' control whether input and output
cause the window to scroll to the end of the buffer."

;;; Directory tracking
;;; ===========================================================================
;;; This code provides the shell mode input sentinel
;;;     SHELL-DIRECTORY-TRACKER
;;; that tracks cd, pushd, and popd commands issued to the shell, and
;;; changes the current directory of the shell buffer accordingly.
;;;
;;; This is basically a fragile hack, although it's more accurate than
;;; the version in Emacs 18's shell.el. It has the following failings:
;;; 1. It doesn't know about the cdpath shell variable.
;;; 2. It cannot infallibly deal with command sequences, though it does well
;;;    with these and with ignoring commands forked in another shell with ()s.
;;; 3. More generally, any complex command is going to throw it. Otherwise,
;;;    you'd have to build an entire shell interpreter in emacs lisp.  Failing
;;;    that, there's no way to catch shell commands where cd's are buried
;;;    inside conditional expressions, aliases, and so forth.
;;;
;;; The whole approach is a crock. Shell aliases mess it up. File sourcing
;;; messes it up. You run other processes under the shell; these each have
;;; separate working directories, and some have commands for manipulating
;;; their w.d.'s (e.g., the lcd command in ftp). Some of these programs have
;;; commands that do *not* affect the current w.d. at all, but look like they
;;; do (e.g., the cd command in ftp).  In shells that allow you job
;;; control, you can switch between jobs, all having different w.d.'s. So
;;; simply saying %3 can shift your w.d..
;;;
;;; The solution is to relax, not stress out about it, and settle for
;;; a hack that works pretty well in typical circumstances. Remember
;;; that a half-assed solution is more in keeping with the spirit of Unix, 
;;; anyway. Blech.
;;;
;;; One good hack not implemented here for users of programmable shells
;;; is to program up the shell w.d. manipulation commands to output
;;; a coded command sequence to the tty. Something like
;;;     ESC | <cwd> |
;;; where <cwd> is the new current working directory. Then trash the
;;; directory tracking machinery currently used in this package, and
;;; replace it with a process filter that watches for and strips out
;;; these messages.

;;; Eric Benson 7/10/91
;;;   Adapted for Emacs 19 by renaming cmushell to shell everywhere.
;;;   Removed (fset 'dirs 'shell-resync-dirs), as that causes M-X dir
;;;    to not call dired.
;;;   Instead of calling cd directly, use comint-cd which does
;;;    substitute-in-file-name.

;;; shell.el ends here
