;;; Commentary:

;;; The changelog is at the end of this file.

;;; Please send me bug reports, bug fixes, and extensions, so that I can
;;; merge them into the master source.
;;;     - Olin Shivers (shivers@cs.cmu.edu)

;;; This file defines a general command-interpreter-in-a-buffer package
;;; (comint mode). The idea is that you can build specific process-in-a-buffer
;;; modes on top of comint mode -- e.g., lisp, shell, scheme, T, soar, ....
;;; This way, all these specific packages share a common base functionality, 
;;; and a common set of bindings, which makes them easier to use (and
;;; saves code, implementation time, etc., etc.).

;;; Several packages are already defined using comint mode:
;;; - shell.el defines a shell-in-a-buffer mode.
;;; - cmulisp.el defines a simple lisp-in-a-buffer mode.
;;;
;;; - The file cmuscheme.el defines a scheme-in-a-buffer mode.
;;; - The file tea.el tunes scheme and inferior-scheme modes for T.
;;; - The file soar.el tunes lisp and inferior-lisp modes for Soar.
;;; - cmutex.el defines tex and latex modes that invoke tex, latex, bibtex,
;;;   previewers, and printers from within emacs.
;;; - background.el allows csh-like job control inside emacs.
;;; It is pretty easy to make new derived modes for other processes.

;;; For documentation on the functionality provided by comint mode, and
;;; the hooks available for customising it, see the comments below.
;;; For further information on the standard derived modes (shell, 
;;; inferior-lisp, inferior-scheme, ...), see the relevant source files.

;;; For hints on converting existing process modes (e.g., tex-mode,
;;; background, dbx, gdb, kermit, prolog, telnet) to use comint-mode
;;; instead of shell-mode, see the notes at the end of this file.


;;; Brief Command Documentation:
;;;============================================================================
;;; Comint Mode Commands: (common to all derived modes, like shell & cmulisp
;;; mode)
;;;
;;; Note: FSF19 binds M-p/M-n to comint-{previous,next}-input instead of
;;;       comint-{previous,next}-similar-input.  Lemacs is more better.
;;;
;;; m-p	    comint-previous-similar-input   Cycle backward in input history
;;; m-n	    comint-next-similar-input       Cycle forward
;;; return  comint-send-input
;;; c-a     comint-bol                      Beginning of line; skip prompt.
;;; c-d	    comint-delchar-or-maybe-eof     Delete char unless at end of buff.
;;; c-c c-u comint-kill-input	    	    ^u
;;; c-c c-w backward-kill-word    	    ^w
;;; c-c c-c comint-interrupt-subjob 	    ^c
;;; c-c c-z comint-stop-subjob	    	    ^z
;;; c-c c-\ comint-quit-subjob	    	    ^\
;;; c-c c-d comint-send-eof	    	    ^d
;;; c-c c-o comint-kill-output		    Delete last batch of process output
;;; c-c c-r comint-show-output		    Show last batch of process output
;;;
;;; Not bound by default in comint-mode
;;; send-invisible			Read a line w/o echo, and send to proc
;;; (These are bound in shell-mode)
;;; comint-dynamic-complete		Complete filename at point.
;;; comint-dynamic-list-completions	List completions in help buffer.
;;; comint-replace-by-expanded-filename	Expand and complete filename at point;
;;;					replace with expanded/completed name.
;;; comint-kill-subjob			No mercy.
;;; comint-continue-subjob		Send CONT signal to buffer's process
;;;					group. Useful if you accidentally
;;;					suspend your process (with C-c C-z).
;;;
;;; These used to be bound for RMS -- I prefer the input history stuff,
;;; but you might like 'em.
;;; m-P	   comint-msearch-input		Search backwards for prompt
;;; m-N    comint-psearch-input		Search forwards for prompt
;;; C-cR   comint-msearch-input-matching Search backwards for prompt & string

;;; comint-mode-hook is the comint mode hook. Basically for your keybindings.
;;; comint-load-hook is run after loading in this package.

;;; Code:

Setting variable `comint-eol-on-send' means jump to the end of the line
before submitting new input.

This mode is typically customised to create Inferior Lisp mode,
Shell mode, etc.  This can be done by setting the hooks
`comint-input-sentinel', `comint-input-filter', `comint-input-sender' and
`comint-get-old-input' to appropriate functions, and the variable
`comint-prompt-regexp' to the appropriate regular expression.

An input history is maintained of size `comint-input-ring-size', and
can be accessed with the commands \\[comint-next-input] and \\[comint-previous-input].
Commands with no default key bindings include `send-invisible',
`comint-dynamic-complete', and `comint-list-dynamic-completions'.

If you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]
to continue it.

a terminal newline is also inserted into the buffer and sent to the process
\(if it is non-nil, all text from the process mark to point is deleted,
since it is assumed the remote process will re-echo it).

The value of variable `comint-input-sentinel' is called on the input
before sending it.  The input is entered into the input history ring,
if the value of variable `comint-input-filter' returns non-nil when
called on the input.

If variable `comint-eol-on-send' is non-nil, then point is moved to the
end of line before sending the input.

`comint-get-old-input', `comint-input-sentinel', and `comint-input-filter'

    comint-input-sentinel monitors input for \"cd\", \"pushd\", and \"popd\" 
        commands. When it sees one, it cd's the buffer.
    comint-input-filter is the default: returns T if the input isn't all white
	space.

If the comint is Lucid Common Lisp, 
    comint-get-old-input snarfs the sexp ending at point.
    comint-input-sentinel does nothing.

;;; Support for source-file processing commands.
;;;============================================================================
;;; Many command-interpreters (e.g., Lisp, Scheme, Soar) have
;;; commands that process files of source text (e.g. loading or compiling
;;; files). So the corresponding process-in-a-buffer modes have commands
;;; for doing this (e.g., lisp-load-file). The functions below are useful
;;; for defining these commands.
;;;
;;; Alas, these guys don't do exactly the right thing for Lisp, Scheme
;;; and Soar, in that they don't know anything about file extensions.
;;; So the compile/load interface gets the wrong default occasionally.
;;; The load-file/compile-file default mechanism could be smarter -- it
;;; doesn't know about the relationship between filename extensions and
;;; whether the file is source or executable. If you compile foo.lisp
;;; with compile-file, then the next load-file should use foo.bin for
;;; the default, not foo.lisp. This is tricky to do right, particularly
;;; because the extension for executable files varies so much (.o, .bin,
;;; .lbin, .mo, .vo, .ao, ...).


;;; COMINT-SOURCE-DEFAULT -- determines defaults for source-file processing
;;; commands.
;;;
;;; COMINT-CHECK-SOURCE -- if FNAME is in a modified buffer, asks you if you
;;; want to save the buffer before issuing any process requests to the command
;;; interpreter.
;;;
;;; COMINT-GET-SOURCE -- used by the source-file processing commands to prompt
;;; for the file to process.

;;; (COMINT-SOURCE-DEFAULT previous-dir/file source-modes)
;;;============================================================================
;;; This function computes the defaults for the load-file and compile-file
;;; commands for tea, soar, cmulisp, and cmuscheme modes. 
;;; 
;;; - PREVIOUS-DIR/FILE is a pair (directory . filename) from the last 
;;; source-file processing command. NIL if there hasn't been one yet.
;;; - SOURCE-MODES is a list used to determine what buffers contain source
;;; files: if the major mode of the buffer is in SOURCE-MODES, it's source.
;;; Typically, (lisp-mode) or (scheme-mode).
;;; 
;;; If the command is given while the cursor is inside a string, *and*
;;; the string is an existing filename, *and* the filename is not a directory,
;;; then the string is taken as default. This allows you to just position
;;; your cursor over a string that's a filename and have it taken as default.
;;;
;;; If the command is given in a file buffer whose major mode is in
;;; SOURCE-MODES, then the the filename is the default file, and the
;;; file's directory is the default directory.
;;; 
;;; If the buffer isn't a source file buffer (e.g., it's the process buffer),
;;; then the default directory & file are what was used in the last source-file
;;; processing command (i.e., PREVIOUS-DIR/FILE).  If this is the first time
;;; the command has been run (PREVIOUS-DIR/FILE is nil), the default directory
;;; is the cwd, with no default file. (\"no default file\" = nil)
;;; 
;;; SOURCE-REGEXP is typically going to be something like (tea-mode)
;;; for T programs, (lisp-mode) for Lisp programs, (soar-mode lisp-mode)
;;; for Soar programs, etc.

;;; (COMINT-GET-SOURCE prompt prev-dir/file source-modes mustmatch-p)
;;;============================================================================
;;; COMINT-GET-SOURCE is used to prompt for filenames in command-interpreter
;;; commands that process source files (like loading or compiling a file).
;;; It prompts for the filename, provides a default, if there is one,
;;; and returns the result filename.
;;; 
;;; See COMINT-SOURCE-DEFAULT for more on determining defaults.
;;; 
;;; PROMPT is the prompt string. PREV-DIR/FILE is the (directory . file) pair
;;; from the last source processing command.  SOURCE-MODES is a list of major
;;; modes used to determine what file buffers contain source files.  (These
;;; two arguments are used for determining defaults). If MUSTMATCH-P is true,
;;; then the filename reader will only accept a file that exists.
;;; 
;;; A typical use:
;;; (interactive (comint-get-source "Compile file: " prev-lisp-dir/file
;;;                                 '(lisp-mode) t))

;;; Converting process modes to use comint mode
;;; ===========================================================================
;;; The code in the Emacs 19 distribution has all been modified to use comint
;;; where needed.  However, there are `third-party' packages out there that
;;; still use the old shell mode.  Here's a guide to conversion.
;;; 
;;; Renaming variables
;;; Most of the work is renaming variables and functions. These are the common
;;; ones:
;;; Local variables:
;;; 	last-input-start        comint-last-input-start
;;; 	last-input-end		comint-last-input-end
;;;	shell-prompt-pattern	comint-prompt-regexp
;;;     shell-set-directory-error-hook <no equivalent>
;;; Miscellaneous:
;;;	shell-set-directory	<unnecessary>
;;; 	shell-mode-map		comint-mode-map
;;; Commands:
;;;	shell-send-input	comint-send-input
;;;	shell-send-eof		comint-delchar-or-maybe-eof
;;; 	kill-shell-input	comint-kill-input
;;;	interrupt-shell-subjob	comint-interrupt-subjob
;;;	stop-shell-subjob	comint-stop-subjob
;;;	quit-shell-subjob	comint-quit-subjob
;;;	kill-shell-subjob	comint-kill-subjob
;;;	kill-output-from-shell	comint-kill-output
;;;	show-output-from-shell	comint-show-output
;;;	copy-last-shell-input	Use comint-previous-input/comint-next-input
;;;
;;; SHELL-SET-DIRECTORY is gone, its functionality taken over by
;;; SHELL-DIRECTORY-TRACKER, the shell mode's comint-input-sentinel.
;;; Comint mode does not provide functionality equivalent to 
;;; shell-set-directory-error-hook; it is gone.
;;; 
;;; comint-last-input-start is provided for modes which want to munge
;;; the buffer after input is sent, perhaps because the inferior
;;; insists on echoing the input.  The LAST-INPUT-START variable in
;;; the old shell package was used to implement a history mechanism,
;;; but you should think twice before using comint-last-input-start
;;; for this; the input history ring often does the job better.
;;; 
;;; If you are implementing some process-in-a-buffer mode, called foo-mode, do
;;; *not* create the comint-mode local variables in your foo-mode function.
;;; This is not modular.  Instead, call comint-mode, and let *it* create the
;;; necessary comint-specific local variables. Then create the
;;; foo-mode-specific local variables in foo-mode.  Set the buffer's keymap to
;;; be foo-mode-map, and its mode to be foo-mode.  Set the comint-mode hooks
;;; (comint-prompt-regexp, comint-input-filter, comint-input-sentinel,
;;; comint-get-old-input) that need to be different from the defaults.  Call
;;; foo-mode-hook, and you're done. Don't run the comint-mode hook yourself;
;;; comint-mode will take care of it. The following example, from shell.el,
;;; is typical:
;;; 
;;; (defun shell-mode ()
;;;   (interactive)
;;;   (comint-mode)
;;;   (setq comint-prompt-regexp shell-prompt-pattern)
;;;   (setq major-mode 'shell-mode)
;;;   (setq mode-name "Shell")
;;;   (use-local-map shell-mode-map)
;;;   (make-local-variable 'shell-dirstack)
;;;   (setq shell-dirstack nil)
;;;   (setq comint-input-sentinel 'shell-directory-tracker)
;;;   (run-hooks 'shell-mode-hook))
;;;
;;;
;;; Note that make-comint is different from make-shell in that it
;;; doesn't have a default program argument. If you give make-shell
;;; a program name of NIL, it cleverly chooses one of explicit-shell-name,
;;; $ESHELL, $SHELL, or /bin/sh. If you give make-comint a program argument
;;; of NIL, it barfs. Adjust your code accordingly...
;;;

;;; Do the user's customisation...

(run-hooks 'comint-load-hook)

;;; Change log:
;;; 9/12/89 
;;;  - Souped up the filename expansion procedures.
;;;    Doc strings are much clearer and more detailed.
;;;    Fixed a bug where doing a filename completion when the point
;;;    was in the middle of the filename instead of at the end would lose.
;;;
;;; 2/17/90 
;;;  - Souped up the command history stuff so that text inserted
;;;    by comint-previous-input-matching is removed by following
;;;    command history recalls. comint-next/previous-input-matching
;;;    is now much more smoothly integrated w/the command history stuff.
;;;  - Added comint-eol-on-send flag and comint-input-sender hook.
;;;    Comint-input-sender based on code contributed by Jeff Peck
;;;    (peck@sun.com).
;;;
;;; 3/13/90 ccm@cmu.cs.edu
;;;  - Added comint-previous-similar-input for looking up similar inputs.
;;;  - Added comint-send-and-get-output to allow snarfing input from
;;;    buffer. 
;;;  - Added the ability to pick up a source file by positioning over
;;;    a string in comint-get-source.
;;;  - Added add-hook to make it a little easier for the user to use
;;;    multiple hooks.
;;;  
;;; 5/22/90 shivers
;;; - Moved Chris' multiplexed ipc stuff to comint-ipc.el.
;;; - Altered Chris' comint-get-source string feature. The string
;;;   is only offered as a default if it names an existing file.
;;; - Changed comint-exec to directly crank up the process, instead
;;;   of calling the env program. This made background.el happy.
;;; - Added new buffer-local var comint-ptyp. The problem is that
;;;   the signalling functions don't work as advertised. If you are
;;;   communicating via pipes, the CURRENT-GROUP arg is supposed to
;;;   be ignored, but, unfortunately it seems to be the case that you
;;;   must pass a NIL for this arg in the pipe case. COMINT-PTYP
;;;   is a flag that tells whether the process is communicating
;;;   via pipes or a pty. The comint signalling functions use it
;;;   to determine the necessary CURRENT-GROUP arg value. The bug
;;;   has been reported to the Gnu folks.
;;; - comint-dynamic-complete flushes the help window if you hit space
;;;   after you execute it.
;;; - Added functions comint-send-string, comint-send-region and var 
;;;   comint-input-chunk-size.  comint-send-string tries to prevent processes
;;;   from hanging when you send them long strings by breaking them into
;;;   chunks and allowing process output between chunks. I got the idea from
;;;   Eero Simoncelli's Common Lisp package. Note that using
;;;   comint-send-string means that the process buffer's contents can change
;;;   during a call!  If you depend on process output only happening between
;;;   toplevel commands, this could be a problem. In such a case, use
;;;   process-send-string instead. If this is a problem for people, I'd like
;;;   to hear about it.
;;; - Added comint-proc-query as a simple mechanism for commands that
;;;   want to query an inferior process and display its response. For a
;;;   typical use, see lisp-show-arglist in cmulisp.el.
;;; - Added constant comint-version, which is now "2.01".
;;;
;;; 6/14/90 shivers
;;; - Had comint-update-env defined twice. Removed extra copy. Also
;;;   renamed mem to be comint-mem, for modularity. The duplication
;;;   was reported by Michael Meissner.
;;; 6/16/90 shivers
;;; - Emacs has two different mechanisms for maintaining the process
;;;   environment, determined at compile time by the MAINTAIN-ENVIRONMENT
;;;   #define. One uses the process-environment global variable, and
;;;   one uses a getenv/setenv interface. comint-exec assumed the
;;;   process-environment interface; it has been generalised (with
;;;   comint-exec-1) to handle both cases. Pretty bogus. We could,
;;;   of course, skip all this and just use the etc/env program to
;;;   handle the environment tweaking, but that obscures process
;;;   queries that other modules (like background.el) depend on. etc/env
;;;   is also fairly bogus. This bug, and some of the fix code was
;;;   reported by Dan Pierson.
;;;
;;; 9/5/90 shivers
;;; - Changed make-variable-buffer-local's to make-local-variable's.
;;;   This leaves non-comint-mode buffers alone. Stephane Payrard
;;;   reported the sloppy usage.
;;; - You can now go from comint-previous-similar-input to
;;;   comint-previous-input with no problem.
;;;
;;; 12/21/90 shivers
;;; - Added a condition-case to comint-get-source. Bogus strings
;;;   beginning with ~ were making the file-exists-p barf.
;;; - Added "=" to the set of chars recognised by file completion
;;;   as constituting a filename.
;;;
;;; 1/90 shivers
;;; These changes comprise release 2.02:
;;; - Removed the kill-all-local-variables in comint-mode. This
;;;   made it impossible for client modes to set things before calling
;;;   comint-mode. (In particular, it messed up ilisp.el) In general,
;;;   the client mode should be responsible for a k-a-l-v's.
;;; - Fixed comint-match-partial-pathname so that it works in
;;;   more cases: if the filename begins at the start-of-buffer;
;;;   if point is on the first char of the filename. Just a question
;;;   of getting the tricky bits right.
;;; - Added a hook, comint-exec-hook that is run each time a process
;;;   is cranked up. Useful for things like process-kill-without-query.
;;;
;;; These two were pointed out by tale:
;;; - Improved the doc string in comint-send-input a little bit.
;;; - Tweaked make-comint to check process status with comint-check-proc
;;;   instead of equivalent inline code. 
;;;
;;; - Prompt-search history commands have been commented out. I never
;;;   liked them; I don't think anyone used them.
;;; - Made comint-exec-hook a local var, as it should have been.
;;;   (This way, for instance, you can have shell procs kill-w/o-query,
;;;    but let Scheme procs be default.)
;;;
;;; 7/91 Shivers
;;; - Souped up comint-read-noecho with an optional argument, STARS.
;;;   Suggested by mjlx@EAGLE.CNSF.CORNELL.EDU.
;;; - Moved comint-previous-input-matching from C-c r to C-M-r.
;;;   C-c <letter> bindings are reserved for the user.
;;;   These bindings were done by Jim Blandy.
;;; These changes comprise version 2.03.
