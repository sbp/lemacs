--------------------------
Installation

To install, put the .el files in some directory in your load-path and
byte-compile them.  Put the following forms in your .emacs file.

(define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map "\C-xx" 'edebug-eval-top-level-form)
(autoload 'edebug-eval-top-level-form "edebug")

If you wish to change the default edebug global command prefix, change this:
(setq edebug-global-prefix "\C-xX")

Other options, are described in the manual.
Also see edebug-emacs19.el, edebug-lemacs.el, cl-specs.el, 
and edebug-cl-read.el if they apply to you.

In previous versions of edebug, users were directed to set
`debugger' to `edebug-debug'.  This is no longer necessary
since edebug automatically sets it whenever any code is being edebugged.
