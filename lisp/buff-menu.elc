Major mode for editing a list of buffers.
Each line describes one of the buffers in Emacs.
Letters do not insert themselves; instead, they are commands.
m -- mark buffer to be displayed.
q -- select buffer of line point is on.
  Also show buffers marked with m in other windows.
1 -- select that buffer in full-screen window.
2 -- select that buffer in one window,
  together with buffer selected before this one in another window.
f -- select that buffer in place of the buffer menu buffer.
o -- select that buffer in another window,
  so the buffer menu buffer remains visible in its window.
t -- visit-tags-table this buffer.
~ -- clear modified-flag on that buffer.
s -- mark that buffer to be saved, and move down.
d or k -- mark that buffer to be deleted, and move down.
C-d -- mark that buffer to be deleted, and move up.
x -- delete or save marked buffers.
u -- remove all kinds of marks from current line.
Delete -- back up a line and remove marks.
