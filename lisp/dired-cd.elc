Run a shell command on the marked files.
If there is output, it goes to a separate buffer.
The list of marked files is appended to the command string unless asterisks
  `*' indicate the place(s) where the list should go.
If no files are marked or a specific numeric prefix arg is given, uses
  next ARG files.  With a zero argument, run command on each marked file
  separately: `cmd * foo' results in `cmd F1 foo; ...; cmd Fn foo'.
  As always, a raw arg (\\[universal-argument]) means the current file.
The option variables dired-cd-same-subdir and dired-cd-on-each
  permit the command(s) to run in the files' directories if appropriate,
  and thus determine where output files are created.  Default is top
  directory.  The prompt mentions the file(s) or the marker, the cd subdir,
  and the on-each flags when they apply.
No automatic redisplay is attempted, as the file names may have
  changed.  Type \\[dired-do-redisplay] to redisplay the marked files." "P"])
