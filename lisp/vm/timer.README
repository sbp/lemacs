Byte-compile the file timer.el and install it in a Lisp library.

C compile the file timer.c and install the resulting executable in one
of the directories in your (or Emacs') search path.  The executable
should be named `timer'.  Use -DUSG if running under System V.  I
couldn't test the code under System V.

A simple example of timer usage appears in the file ntime.el, which
contains a no-frills rewrite of Emacs' time.el.
