How to setup VM:

0) Look at the Makefile and change the values of EMACS_VERSION,
   EMACS, INFODIR, LISPDIR, SUPPORT_EL and SUPPORT_ELC if they
   are not right for your system.

1) Do one of these:
     `make'.
     `make vm.info' to build the Info online help document.
     `make all' to make everything.
   Ignore the compiler warnings.

2) Put all the .elc files into a Lisp directory that Emacs knows
   about.  (see load-path).

3) If you built the Info document, copy the file vm.info file into
   the Emacs' info directory under the name "vm".  Edit the "dir"
   file in that directory and add a menu entry for VM, if it's
   not in there already.

4) Put these lines in your .emacs file if they aren't there
   already:

   (autoload 'vm "vm" "Start VM on your primary inbox." t)
   (autoload 'vm-visit-folder "vm" "Start VM on an arbitrary folder." t)
   (autoload 'vm-visit-virtual-folder "vm" "Visit a VM virtual folder." t)
   (autoload 'vm-mode "vm" "Run VM major mode on a buffer" t)
   (autoload 'vm-mail "vm" "Send a mail message using VM." t)
   (autoload 'vm-submit-bug-report "vm" "Send a bug report about VM." t)

You're now ready to use VM.  C-h i should start up the Emacs Info
system and if you've installed the Info document properly you can
use the online documentation to teach yourself how to use VM.
(Note: the Info document is currently only completely accurate for
version 4 of VM.)

Please use M-x vm-submit-bug-report to report bugs.  The bug report
will be sent to bug-vm@uunet.uu.net and be gatewayed from there to
gnu.emacs.vm.bug.

The latest version of VM can usually be found at ftp.uu.net in
the networking/mail/vm directory.
