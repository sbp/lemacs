How to setup VM:

0) Look at the Makefile and change the values of EMACS_VERSION, EMACS,
   INFODIR and LISPDIR if they are not right for your system.

1) `make'.
   `make vm.info' to build the Info online help document.
   `make all' to make everything.
   The byte compiler will spew a lot of warnings which you should
   ignore unless something doesn't get built.  After a `make' you
   should have vm.elc, sets.elc and tapestry.elc.  `make all'
   creates a vm.info file as well.

2) Put the vm.elc, sets.elc and tapestry.elc file in a Lisp
   directory that Emacs knows about.  (see load-path).  You don't
   need to install the other .elc files.

3) If you built the Info document, copy the file vm.info file into
   the Emacs' info directory under the name "vm".  Edit the "dir"
   file in that directory and add a menu entry for VM, if it's
   not in there already.

4) Put these lines in your .emacs file if they aren't there
   already:

   (autoload 'vm "vm" "Start VM mail reader" t)
   (autoload 'vm-mode "vm" "Run VM major mode on a buffer" t)

You're now ready to use VM.  C-h i should start up the Emacs Info
system and if you've installed the Info document properly you can
use the online documentation to teach yourself how to use VM.

Please use M-x vm-submit-bug-report to report bugs.  The bug report
will be sent to bug-vm@uunet.uu.net and be gatewayed from there to
gnu.emacs.vm.bug.

The latest version of VM can usually be found at ftp.uu.net in
the mail/vm directory.
