How to setup VM:

1) `make'.  `make all' if you want the Info document built as well.

2) Put the vm.elc files in a Lisp directory that Emacs knows
   about.  (see load-path).  You don't need to install the other
   .elc files, only vm.elc.

3) Copy the file vm file into the Emacs' info directory under the
   name "vm".  Edit the "dir" file in that directory and add a menu
   entry for VM.

Mail bug reports to bug-vm@uunet.uu.net or post them to gnu.emacs.vm.bug.

Note: this version of VM has been hacked by Lucid.
