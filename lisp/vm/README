How to setup VM:

1) `make'.  `make all' if you want the Info document built as well.

2) Put the .elc files in a Lisp directory that Emacs knows about.
   (see load-path).

3) Copy the file vm.info file into the Emacs' info directory under the
   name "vm".  Edit the "dir" file in that directory and add a menu
   entry for VM.
