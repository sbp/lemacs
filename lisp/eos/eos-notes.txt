Notes to Implementors


TO BE DONE

left-margin on per-screen basis
	This would provide a feedback that the given screen is
	handling messages

command to recover state in debugger.
	Browser has little state; debugger has much more. If the
	editor (or an important buffer) goes away, glyphs are not easy
	to recover

Use file-truename so that identical files with different paths get
	to the same buffer (as in the browser database)

Handle multiple instances of debugger/browser clients.

I-search for stop-signs (across all buffers)


BUGS

/Common

1-	Color setting is broken.
	FIXED; needs integration

/Debuggger

1 -	an occasional "nil is not an annotation" message
	weath@eng, quenelle@eng

2 -	glyphs are not removed when the debugger dies
	weath@eng, quenelle@eng
	FIXED; awaiting VERIFICATION

3 -	glyph backgrounds are always white
	weath@eng; phc
	FIXED; awaiting VERIFICATION

4 -	deleting character at beginning of line removes glyphs
	(bug in annotation code)
	weath@eng
	NEEDS changes to annotation implementation

5 -	If you put a bpt on the closing curly brace of a function, the
	solid arrow hides it when you hit the bpt.  I'd rather the text
	shift right to show both glyphs (and stay shifted; don't jump back!).
	weath@eng
	partial FIXED (made it 5 chars; created a variable for it).

6-	If a debugger arrow & a breakpoint are on the same place and "clear"
	is requested, one of the two glyphs is removed more or less randomly.
	FIXED

7-	../.. & breakpoints...
	gramlich
	PASSED to dbx.
