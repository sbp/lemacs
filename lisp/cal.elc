Display three-month calendar in another window.
The three months appear side by side, with the current month in the middle
surrounded by the previous and next months.  The cursor is put on today's date.

An optional prefix argument ARG causes the calendar displayed to be
ARG months in the future if ARG is positive or in the past if ARG is
negative; in this case the cursor goes on the first day of the month.

The Gregorian calendar is assumed.

After preparing the calendar window, the hooks calendar-hook are run
when the calendar is for the current month--that is, the was no prefix
argument.  If the calendar is for a future or past month--that is, there
was a prefix argument--the hooks offset-calendar-hook are run.  Thus, for
example, setting calendar-hooks to 'star-date will cause today's date to be
replaced by asterisks to highlight it in the window." "P"])
