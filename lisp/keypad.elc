Set up keymap MAP to forward to function-keymap according to TRANSLATIONS.
TRANSLATIONS is an alist; each element of it looks like (FROMSTRING . TOCHAR).
For each such pair, we define the key sequence FROMSTRING in MAP
to forward to the definition of character TOCHAR in function-keymap.
\"Forwarding\" means that subsequent redefinition of TOCHAR in
function-keymap will be seen automatically in MAP as well.

This function is used by files term/*.el to set up the mapping from the
escape sequences sent by function keys on particular terminals (FROMSTRINGs)
into Emacs standard function key slots (TOCHARs).
Generally, MAP is a prefix keymap which will be attached to a key
that is the common prefix sent by all function keys (often ESC O or ESC [)."])
