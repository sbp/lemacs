* w3.el: Forgot to (widen) after the new MIME parasing code.


* w3.el: Rewrote w3-parse-mime-headers to extract its information from the
buffer instead of doing lots of work on strings/etc.  Also rewrote
part of the guessing of mime-types when no content-type explicitly
given.

Seem to have fixed the problem of inlined images not being used as links.


* w3-lemacs.el:
w3-find-specific-link will now highlight the correct extent until

<p> tag weren't filled correctly.

and use add-hook instead of explicit setq's

* w3.el: Fixed bug in title handling if there was an end tag like <title >

* w3-lemacs.el:

support the Status: header, which will be shown instead of the normal
XXX bytes message.

* w3-vars.el: More HTML+ entities

* w3.el: <HR> is now honored within <PRE> segments.
* w3-lemacs.el, w3-vars.el, w3.el: Changed some more of the internal

* w3.el, w3-vars.el: New variable w3-graphics-always-show-entities.  If t
  (the default), then the small inlined graphics will always be shown,
  regardless of the value of w3-delay-image-loads.

  19)
* w3.el: Added in support for <OL|UL|DL FOLDED="yes">, to hide sublists.
* w3.el: Removed changing of w3-xxx-delimit-links when following links for
  now. Did not work 100% of the time.
* w3-emacs19.el: Now get rid of annoying automatically-turned-on-menubar
  in emacs19...

Wed Mar 23 23:53:22 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Changed all calls to process-status to be w3-process-status
* w3.el: Added function w3-accept-process-output that will block and
  timeout on a read instead of exiting immediately in emacs' that support
  it (everything but vanilla 18.59 and mule)
* dist.Makefile: Added target to compile w3-mac


Tue Mar 22 23:05:07 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: Wrote a w3-insert for emacs19 that nukes all text
  properties after insertion
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el,
  w3-vars.el: Now check for whether hyperbole has been loaded before

  w3-visited-node-style when it is followed.
* w3-emacs.el: Check to make sure that system-type is next-mach before
  loading the Emacs 18.xx NeXT extensions
* w3.el: Fixes to the image code and the OPTION/SELECT form parsing.
* w3-vars.el: Changes to w3-graphic-converter-alist
* w3-lemacs.el: Stop using start-open and 'end-open properties

Mon Mar 21 22:40:01 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el: Put in code
  to actually create the new w3-visited-node-style face.
* w3-lemacs.el: Fixed problem with w3-insert at the end of the buffer
* w3.el: Changed the icon directory to be a list of possible sites, keep
  the hits in w3-icon-path-cache to save time.  Adds the ..../etc/w3/
  directory to the search path automatically in w3-do-setup
* w3.el: Stuck in a few nntp-XXXX macros from gnus.el so I don't have to
  require 'gnus
* w3.el: New variable w3-link-delimiter-info.  This can be a function that
  should return a string to insert at the end of a hypertext link.
  Intended for things like 'interestingness' functions, etc, but can be
  used for just about anything.  It is passed the full url of the link as
  its only argument.
* w3.el: Must now specify w3-link-start-delimiter and
  w3-link-end-delimiter as a cons pair.  The car is the string to insert
  before/after a link that has not been visited before, and the cdr is the
  string to insert before/after a link that has been visited.
* w3.el: Can now specify whether personal annotations should appear at the
  top or bottom of a document.  Variable w3-annotation-position can be
  either 'top or 'bottom.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed the problem with going from the first form button
  on a page to a previous hyperlink button.
* w3-lemacs.el: Rewrote w3-insert for lucid 19.9+...
* w3.el: Fixed several forms-related problems.
* w3.el: Input type=hidden implemented
* w3.el: Now strips out ?... from urls that you are searching on.  No more
  xxxx?xxx?yyy.
* New definition of b0, so authentication shouldn't bomb on some urls
  anymore
* w3-vars.el: Added new face - w3-visited-node-style - that is used
  instead of w3-node-style if the url has been visited already.

Fri Mar 18 13:50:59 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem with usernames in ftp links not being carried over
  with relative links (w3-parse-relative-link xxx).
* w3-emacs19.el: w3-zone-data now correctly returns w3graphic zones.
* w3-docomp.el: Added in stuff so that new lucid doesn't barf out warnings
  when compiling w3-old-lemacs.el

Thu Mar 17 18:54:08 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: Minor change to w3-link-begin-regexp
* w3.el: New function w3-parse-args that takes an attribute block from an
  SGML element and returns an assoc list of attributes and their values.
  Lots of changes throughout the code to take advantage of it.  No more
  (string-match <funky regexp> x), etc.
* w3-vars.el: Added entry for x-pixmap in graphic converter alist
* w3-vars.el: Fixed dumb problem with menus and the newly renamed hotlist
  functions
* w3.el: Fixed problem with double typing when w3-use-hypertext-gopher is nil.
* w3.el: Added code in to keep the old value of kill-emacs-hook laying
  around in emacs18 so that w3 doesn't overwrite any of the other hooks.

Mon Mar 14 22:10:37 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: Added a few items to the menus

Sun Mar 13 22:43:16 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed dumb problem in w3-save-as... thanks to Eyvind Ness
  <Eyvind.Ness@hrp.no> for pointing it out

Fri Mar 11 23:05:04 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Set w3-delayed-images to nil so you can't load them twice...
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-form-cursor that specifies the cursor to use
  when entering a form.
* w3-lemacs.el: Clicking on an image will work correctly in lucid emacs
  now... was not returning a 'w3graphic object with w3-zone-data
* w3-lemacs.el: Changed w3-add-zone to take advantage of my proposed
  change to x-track-pointer, just in case it is included...
* w3-vars.el: Fixed problem in the entities list with &Szlig; being
  capitalized...

Wed Mar  9 21:29:25 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Make sure that the delimiters around headers don't extend over
  two or more lines - looked real ugly if you had multi-line headers.
* w3.el: Fixed emacs-18 problem with kill-emacs-hook being a list of
  functions. Also changed the way w3-mode saves/restores a list of
  buffer-local variables - new variable w3-persistent-variables is a list
  of variables to preserve when entering w3-mode.  Much easier to add new
  vars to than adding in a (setq xxx (nth yyyy tmp)) in w3-mode.

Mon Mar  7 13:34:28 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Rewrote w3-grok-gopher-link so it doesn't create huge strings
  every time it is invoked.  Caused LOTS of garbage collection.  Using
  skip-chars-forward works _much_ faster and is more efficient.

Sun Mar  6 23:05:21 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-personal-mail-address that is sent as the
  From: field in http/1.0 requests
* w3-vars.el: Fixed documentation strings to not have entity references in
  them. Also extended documentation for several variables.
* w3-vars.el: Changed default value of w3-track-mouse to be t.
* w3-old-lemacs.el: New version of w3-mouse-handler for old versions of
  lucid.
* w3.el: Rewrote w3-load-delayed images to use mapcar and apply instead of
  taking the (nth x (car something) to extract the info.  Should be
  faster, although probably not noticeable.  Also load the images in
  reverse order, so they appear in the correct order.
* w3.el: Fixed DUMBASS problem in w3-create-mime-request.  Was sending a
  full url instead of just the filename portion in an HTTP/1.0 request.
* w3-vars.el, w3.el: Added uuencoding and uudecoding functions.  Needed
  for sending ripem auth requests

Sat Mar  5 21:09:46 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem with w3-basepath and null arguments.
* w3.el: Fixed relative links from within previewed buffers.
* w3.el: Fixed fill-out forms post submissions, and general problem with
  w3-create-mime-request and w3-request-extra-headers
* w3.el: Fixed problem with dired-type listings of files in w3-mode
* w3.el: Corrected check for file size of -1 in w3-format-directory
* w3.el: Changed default content-type to be text/plain.  If there is no
  content-type defined, try to figure out if a buffer is hypertext or not,
  and set the content-type to text/html if it is.
* w3.el: The graphical entities can now be specified as a list of two
  strings. First is the bitmap filename, the second is similar to the ALT
  tag in images.

Fri Mar  4 21:57:48 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-wais-to-mime that converts wais doctypes
  into MIME content-types
* w3.el: New way to retrieve wais doc-ids... doesn't work all the time
  though - why not?
* w3.el: Removed the call to dps-display-color-cells, as it causes a
  coredump in all the versions I have ever tried on the NeXT.
* w3-lemacs.el: Fixed problem with quoting percents in w3-track-mouse.

Thu Mar  3 18:57:03 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem in new header handling.
* w3.el: w3-file-attributes will no longer choke if given a null argument.
* w3-search.el: Remove all '#XXXX' references from URLs, so it is easier
  to tell if we have visited them before
* w3-vars.el: Changed w3-header-chars-assoc to use characters instead of
  strings, and use make-string to make the header delimiters the same size
  as the header.  This can still mess up on headers with inlined images,
  but all in all it looks much better.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for the
  suggestion.
* w3.el: Changed lots of functions to use mapcar instead of while loops -
  sould be slightly faster.
* w3.el: Added hook to kill-emacs-hook to write out the global history if
  necessary.  Also rewrote part of w3-write-global-history 

Wed Mar  2 21:57:44 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem with w3-file-attributes and non-existend
  local/remote files.
* dist.Makefile: Added mac and searching files to the distribution.
* w3.el: w3-retrieve now updates w3-global-history-completion-list
* w3.el: w3-fetch now does a completing read so that you can have
  completion based on your .mosaic-global-history file.
* w3-search.el: w3-do-search can now take an optional BASE argument, that
  is the url to start searching from.  The search function also now checks
  to see if there is a buffer visiting a url in the queue before
  retrieving it.
* w3.el: w3-save-as now uses w3-current-source if possible.  Saves time on
  retrieval.
* w3-vars.el: Fixed menu entry for 'View Source' that was still calling
  old function names.
* w3-lemacs.el: If w3-track-mouse is non-nil, and w3-link-cursor is
  defined, change the mouse cursor to w3-link-cursor when over a link.
  w3-link-cursor defaults to "hand2".  w3-link-cursor is set up in
  w3-do-setup only if w3-link-cursor is a string, so the user can set it
  to a pixmap in their .emacs file if they wish.
* w3.el: <BR>s in lists now handled better.
* w3.el: The new graphic entity support now honors the
  w3-delay-image-loads variable

Tue Mar  1 23:55:50 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lemacs.el, w3-epoch.el: Added binding of w3-source to 't' so that
  w3-retrieve will always grab a buffer for retrieving inlined images
* w3-search.el: Miscellaneous fixes...
* w3.el: More changes to w3-file-attributes to compensate for HTTP/1.0
  servers that don't implement HEAD
* w3.el: Fixed error in determining if a URL exists or not in
  w3-file-attributes
* w3.el: w3-file-attributes won't send a HEAD request to a known
  non-http/1.0 server
* w3-search.el: Can now specify the search term as a function, and it will
  be funcall'd with the URL as an argument.  RESTRICTION can be either a
  regular expression or a function name - if string-match or funcall
  against the URL fails, don't insert it into the queue.  Also now smarter
  about not visiting the same URL multiple times.
* w3.el: Fixed a dumb mistake in w3-file-attributes
* w3-search.el: The searching functions work now.  Takes a regular
  expression and a max-hops argument.  Returns a list of URLs that the
  regular expression was found in.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed problem with radio buttons/checkboxes at the end of
  lines in emacs19
* w3.el: Don't send the referer: field if using as a home-page or manually
  requested URL

Mon Feb 28 22:12:18 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el, w3-vars.el: Removed
  redundant definitions of w3-XXXX-menu.  w3-options-menu is still in each
  file, since new lucid emacs has some extra features I can use in it.
* w3.el: Will no longer copy local files into a buffer, then into /tmp
  when passing to an external viewer - creates a symbolic link instead.

Mon Feb 28 03:24:33 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Release of v2.0.22
* w3.texinfo: Description of new proxy services.

* w3-vars.el: Fixed un-escaped "s in defvar for w3-proxy-services
* w3.el: Changed gopher/ftp/file directory handling to use the new
  graphical entities instead of IMG
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-graphics-entities-alist holds an assoc list
  of entities and the names of bitmaps to replace them with.
  w3-icon-directory is appended to the front of each filename
  automatically.
  New variable w3-gopher-icons which holds the new graphic entity
  references to describe each type of object.
* w3.el: Tweaks to wais code... seems to be working now.
* w3.el: Fixed stupid problem in the basic authorization code where I
  wasn't setting the variable in a while loop to (cdr var)
* w3.el: Added in proxy gateway support as put forth by Lou Montulli and
  others.  Uses the new ACCESS_proxy environment variables.
* w3.el: Multiline text entry boxes now reset correctly when
  w3-revert-form is called
* w3.el: Single input-area forms now submit themselves after you enter the
  data.  No need for a submit button.
* w3.el: Fixed error in w3-http, where it was sending the output of
  w3-view-this-url instead of w3-view-url to w3-create-mime-request.
  Referer: fields will work better now.
  Basic authorization will now work with inheritance from protected
  directories. (/foo/bar/baz.html is protected, then so is
  /foo/bar/quuux.html, as is /foo/bar/baz/temp.html, etc)
* w3.el: Wais support seems to be working...
* w3.el: More fixes to the wais searching functions.

Sat Feb 26 20:44:39 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Changed w3-prepare-buffer to take an optional argument,
  no-display, which if t will keep it from renaming the buffer and
  displaying it.
* w3-vars.el: Added &lt and &gt to the list of entities, even though they
  are wrong, since so many people seem to be using them.
* w3.el: Strip out port numbers in ftp requests.
* w3-lemacs.el: Spaces are now inserted after a graphic in lucid, and the
  graphic extent is only on that one space.
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el: Changed w3-zone-at to
  return the extent, not the data.
* w3.el: Better cleaning of telnet buffers before parsing.
* w3.el: Fully implemented the Referer: field.  Also, w3-mime-response-p
  should be a little more robust.  Should also kill an http request when
  using the gateway support.
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-telnet-header-regexp that takes the place of
  w3-telnet-header-length.  Addition of dvi, tex, and texinfo files to the
  w3-mime-extensions list.
* w3.el: Few changes to w3-format-directory in case file-attributes
  returns nil
* w3-emacs.el: w3-map-links will actually work in emacs 18 now.

Fri Feb 25 23:17:51 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lemacs.el: Another dumb mistake in w3-zone-at
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el, w3.el: Fixed
  dumb mistakes in w3-zone-at and the newly rewritten commands
* w3.el: Fixed a few typos in w3-source-document
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el,
  w3.el: Rewrote w3-load-delayed-images, w3-view-this-url, and
  w3-follow-link to use the generic w3-zone-at/w3-zone-data functions, so
  they won't have to be in the emacs-specific files anymore.  Much easier
  to maintain them this way.
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el,
  w3.el: Removed all emacs-specific versions of w3-complete-link, and put
  w3-complete-link into w3.el and have it use the new w3-map-links.
  Easier to maintain.
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el: New function
  w3-map-links that calls a specified function on all the links in a
  certain buffer.
* w3-mac.el: Basic support for Macintosh menus... wrote a function to use
  the lucid style menu descriptions.
* w3-lemacs.el: Fixed problem with bad add-menu structure when the Options
  menu already exists.

* w3.texinfo: New chapter on future directions
* w3-epoch.el: Fixed epoch graphics handling so it won't get a buffer
  read-only-error, and also won't always look in w3-working-buffer, in
  case the buffer has been renamed by the time it gets called.
* w3.el: Renamed several functions so that it will be easier for new users
  to do command completion (all hotlist stuff is w3-hotlist-XXX, etc).
  Also several new functions to operate on the url the cursor is on
  (w3-mail-document-under-point, w3-source-document-at-point, others).
* w3-vars.el: Changed lots of keybindings.  General rule is now that
  lowercase keys act on the current URL, and uppercase works on the url
  under point. Major changes:
  s -> document source, NOT SEARCH
  M-s -> search document
  p -> print document, NOT back link
  Q -> w3-leave-buffer
* w3.el: Rewrote w3-store-in-cache so that it stores info on disk instead
  of in memory - can have a larger cache this way and not use up all your
  memory.
* w3-lemacs.el: New function w3-write-zones that creates lisp expressions
  that restores extents when it is eval'd.

Wed Feb 23 03:50:06 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: A few more changes to the wais code
* w3.el: More refinements to the WAIS code... now outputs URLs that are
  like lynx/Mosaic, and also compatible with the WAIS gateway that NCSA
  provides.

Tue Feb 22 23:39:43 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-old-lemacs.el: Fixed a few nesting errors in w3-view-this-url
* w3-emacs19.el: Few fixes to file-name-handler stuff
* w3.el: WAIS handling can now output an html document of a search.

  document given its doc-id.
* w3-emacs19.el: Patch for setting up the file-name-handler-alist from
  jsc@mit.edu
* w3.el: New function to parse out the .mosaic-global-history file and
  store it in an assoc list for use in completion.
* w3-mac.el: Initial revision
* w3.el: More changes to the wais handling code.
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-waisq-prog that controls where the waisq
  executable is looked for.
* w3.el: Small change to w3-convert-html-to-latex to have slightly better
  stripping of unknown tags.
  Skeleton of wais support - requires waisq from Thinking Machines Corp's
  wais8-5b1.

Mon Feb 21 17:36:25 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: New function w3-quotify-attributes to try and fix bad html docs.
* w3.el: Added a few changes to convert-html-to-latex to honor
  w3-latex-docstyle, and also allows inlining of postscript images.
  Thanks to benno@rainbow.ldgo.columbia.edu (Benno Blumenthal) for the
  batches.

* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-latex-docstyle that controls what
  documentstyle a latex document has.  Useful for going into two-column
  mode or doublesided, etc.
* w3-lemacs.el: Changed w3-back-link to go to 1+ the extent start position
  to get around (extent-at) bug
* w3-vars.el: Added www to the nonrelative link regular expression so that
  links of that type will be parsed correctly.  New variable
  w3-current-source holds the HTML source of a document.
* w3.el: Most of the automatically generated html can now be referenced
  with URLs like WWW://type/data.  Errors are generated this way, and you
  can get the source for things like hotlists, history lists, help items,
  etc.
  Now stores the complete source of a document in a buffer-local variable,
  so printing/mailing HTML and/or LaTeX is _MUCH_ faster, as is getting
  the documents source - never any need to refetch it.  w3-reload-document
  still does a fresh fetch though.
* w3-emacs.el: w3-next-zone and w3-previous-zone now skip 'w3graphic zones
* w3.el: Fixed small bug in re-insertion of SELECT menu items.  Stuck too
  many spaces at the end of it.
* w3-emacs.el: Make sure that x-popup-menu is bound before fset'ing
  w3-x-popup-menu to it when in emacs 18

Fri Feb 18 02:50:42 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem in the textarea handling... misplaced a )...

Thu Feb 17 19:38:50 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem with w3-quotify-percents and null arguments...
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-old-lemacs.el, w3.el: Use
  w3-quotify-percents in the (format ...) command in w3-view-this-url and
  w3-view-url so that form queries don't mess up the format command` and
  make it think it needs more arguments.
* w3-emacs.el: Use insert-before markes in emacs 18
* w3.el: Append fill-prefix to the paragraph parsing code.

Wed Feb 16 21:47:33 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed dumb mistake in the setting up of
  file-name-handler-alist... losing because of a misplaced ')'.  Gotta
  love lisp :)
* w3.el: Lots more file-ish type functions that will work with URLs.
  w3-directory-p, real file-attributes, and stubs for more.
* w3-emacs19.el: Redid the file-name-handler functions.  Stole
  layout/ideas from the ange-ftp stuff from v19.
* w3.el: Will check if running on a mono display and do dithering if it
  is. Fixed problem with <LINK> parsing where it would delete too many
  chars. Fixed problem with queries in w3-form-encode... too many &'s
  Few more NeXTstep changes.
* w3-lemacs.el: Lemacs menu's should no longer nuke people's Options menu
  if it already exists.  Will add a submenu called 'WWW' to the
  already-existing menu.
* w3-emacs19.el: Added file-name-handler-alist support for emacs 19.
  Works for find-file-other-window, find-file-other-screen, file-exists-p,
  file-readable-p, file-executable-p, file-attributes, and
  file-directory-p.
* w3.el: Added new functions w3-file-size and w3-file-exists.
* w3-emacs19.el: A few changes for NeXTstep emacs 19.  Menus now work,
  storing URLS into the kill ring/NeXT clipboard, and loading of lmenu if
  in dps. Still no [x|dps]-popup-menu though.

Tue Feb 15 03:42:45 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed w3-form-encode so that it actually returns the correct
  query string if in a gopher or isindex form area...

Mon Feb 14 19:12:31 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Multiline text area entry should now work in emacs 18 (put the
  w3-do-text-entry outside of the save-excursion)
* w3.el: Make w3-prepare-buffer mark the buffer as not modified.
* w3-lemacs.el: Change w3-insert to insert-before-markers so that inlined
  images will show up in the right place more often.

Sat Feb 12 03:15:46 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed a read-only buffer problem when fetching images...
* w3-lemacs.el: New version of w3-track-mouse that doesn't need to move
  (point) in the buffer... should be faster.

Thu Feb 10 21:47:56 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Moved the image parsing until after everything else has been
  parsed... this should fix everyones problems with inlined images
  disappearing sometimes - they were attached to parts of the buffer that
  was removed by other parsing routines.
* dist.Makefile: The making of w3.info now changes the setfilename
  directive in w3.texinfo to point to INFODIR.
* w3-lemacs.el: Set end-open and start-open extent properties if setting
  up a form.
* w3.el: Fixed a type in one of the mule/forms patches.
* w3-mule.el, w3-vars.el, w3.el: Miscellaneous fixes from Shin-ya Sato
  <sato@mahler.NTT.JP> that make forms work much better in Mule.

Wed Feb  9 23:37:11 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lemacs.el: Don't mess with graphic extents in w3-fix-extent-endpoints

Mon Feb  7 03:31:17 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.texinfo: miscellaneous fixes/grammatical fixups
* w3-epoch.el, w3-lemacs.el: Removed stupid message about possibly failing
  to load an image because of the color map.

Sun Feb  6 19:24:27 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: Changed w3-default-homepage to be defvar'd to nil, so that
  w3-do-setup will grab the WWW_HOME variable if it can.
* w3.texinfo: Fixed a few stupid bugs in @node structures that occurred
  because I removed a node.
* w3.el: Fix entity references in <TITLE> of documents.

Sat Feb  5 02:55:05 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Version 2.0 released.
* w3.el: w3-public-key-exists will actually work now.
* w3.el: Moved the w3-handle-graphics call within the let binding of
  w3-handle-base, so that inlined images will work with <BASE> tags.  This
  also fixes the problem of not being able to select the link an image is
  covering with an ALT tag.
* w3.el: Renamed w3-lemacs-19.8 to w3-old-lemacs because of problems with
  v18 byte compiler.

Fri Feb  4 17:11:03 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: Change w3-running-lemacs and w3-running-new-lucid to be
  w3-running-old-lemacs and w3-running-lemacs, respectively.
* w3-epoch.el, w3-lemacs.el, w3-vars.el, w3.el: Revamped some of the
  w3-insert-graphic code so the conversion functions can be shared between
  epoch & lucid.  Also added in code so that people with only XBM support
  can use the inlined image code.
* w3.el: Added functions to grab the servers public key from finger
  information if possible when using PGP and PEM encryption
* w3-html+.el: Much better table parsing routines - still not finished yet.

Thu Feb  3 22:17:19 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Allow ~s in urls in w3-get-url-at-point
* w3.el: Moved just the variable definitions to an outside file to ease
  byte-compiling.  No longer loads whole w3.el just to get variable
  definitions
* w3.el: Moved w3-load-flavors into w3-do-setup

Wed Feb  2 22:41:48 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

* w3-new-lucid.el: Fixed a free variable reference in w3-insert-graphics
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el,
  w3-next.el, w3.el: Moved some version-specific stuff out of the
  definition of w3-mode and into the function w3-mode-version-specifics in
  the w3-*.el files.
* w3.el: Set w3-delimit-emphasis and w3-delimit-links to nil when doing
  batch fetches.
* w3.el: Mailing and batch-fetching now insert a <BASE> tag if
  sending/saving the raw HTML.
* w3.el: Fixed a few typos in w3-tn3270

  functions.
* w3.el: New variable w3-use-transparent.  If t, then it will use
  transparent.el to do telnet/tn3270 links.  This is automatically set to
  nil if you are in lucid emacs, epoch, or in a windowing system.
* w3-mule.el: Added function w3-m2psbuffer that will print a buffer as
  postscript in mule.
* Renamed w3.texi to w3.texinfo
* w3.el: Replaced <= with equal in case file size is nil...

Sun Jan 30 18:40:16 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

  they didn't already exist.  Also added a patch from Jamie Zawinski that
  fixes the ###autoload statements used by autoload.el
* w3.texi: Now creates .info files just fine from makeinfo.

Sat Jan 29 23:35:59 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el, w3.el: Added
  an (fset 'w3-insert 'insert) to all but the epoch file, and used the
  w3-insert written by Henry A. Rowley that will keep the zones intact.

* w3-epoch.el: Getting the resource for underlining should work now.
* w3.el: w3-add-document-to-hotlist now checks to see if the current
  document is already in the hotlist.  If it is, it signals an error.

  the sed command
* w3-epoch.el, w3-new-lucid.el, w3.el: Changed how the
  w3-graphic-converter-alist is specified.  Must now leave off the
  ppmtoxpm command, and leave a stray '| ' at the en end of the
  conversion.  The contents of the variable w3-ppmtoxpm-command are
  appended to this string.
* w3.el: Added a w3-convert-code-for-mule call in w3-sentinel if
  w3-be-asynchronous is t.
* w3-new-lucid.el: Several changes suggested by Jamie Zawinski
  (jwz@lucid.com) More errror checking for the image loading, and display
  a buffer describing each error in a buffer after parsing the buffer.
  Also, if the image load fails, put a 'w3graphic zone over the [alt] tag.
* w3.el: Several changes suggested by Jamie Zawinski (jwz@lucid.com) The
  small extent made for graphics has the 'w3graphic property, so using
  w3-follow-inlined-image on it will retrieve the full picture (for things
  like lucid where it gets clipped to the line height).  No longer shows
  'read 1 byte' messages - will only show a message when it has acually
  received some info.
* w3.el: Removed assumption that /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt exists when using
  ppmtoxpm

Fri Jan 28 13:39:11 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

  fix not being able to get past graphic extents in 19.9
* w3.el: The w3-nonrelative-link regexp now includes wais link types.
* w3-emacs.el: Added a patch from arup@cmu.edu that fixed yet another dumb
  mistake on my part in the emacs 18 w3-follow-link function.
* w3.el: Basics of w3-pem-auth for the new httpd pgp/pem security
* w3.texi: Documentation mime-types parsing, and viewer specifications.
* w3.el: Viewers can now be lists, in which case it will be passed thru
  'eval'.

Tue Jan 25 20:33:15 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs.el: Fix from arup@cmu.edu for a problem in w3-follow-link for
  emacs 18
* w3-new-lucid.el: The problem with coredumps with lots of empty links in
  lemacs 19.9 should (hopefully) be fixed.
* w3.el: Added wais gateway support - not sure if it  works, but I get the
  same results as I do with Mosaic, so good enough.
* w3.el: Asynchronous retrieval over http works again.
* w3-new-lucid.el, w3-epoch.el: Made sure w3-insert-graphic retrieved
  graphics synchronously.

Mon Jan 24 23:30:40 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

  that display the contents of the hotlist-type w3-starting-documents
  variable.

  HREF...></A> construct in a buffer.  Url is the url of the current
  buffer (or link under point with prefix arg), text of the link defaults
  to the title of the buffer or the text of the link under cursor.  Buffer
  to insert into is prompted for.
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el: Added function
  w3-zone-at that returns the zone at the position passed to the function
  (can be point or marker).
* w3.el: Changed the inlined images to have the highlight attribute if
  possible.
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-new-lucid.el, w3.el: Rewrote lots of
  functions so that inlined images are stored in their own zone, and
  control-middle-mouse-button or M-x w3-follow-inlined-image will fetch
  the inlined image and send it to an external viewer. w3-follow-link will
  also get an inlined image if it cannot find a hyperlink or a form entry
  area under cursor.
* w3-emacs.el: Added w3-zone-eq for emacs 18 so that radio buttons will
  work.
* w3.el: Changed w3-handle-graphics so that if w3-delay-image-loads is t,
  use a marker instead of an absolute (point) reference.
* w3-new-lucid.el: Fixed a problem in the delayed image loading - would
  always try to find w3-working-buffer, which would (should) not exist
  when doing a delayed load.
* w3-new-lucid.el: Added missing interactive spec to
  w3-load-delayed-images
* w3-new-lucid.el: Added function w3-load-delayed-images, and activated

  directories more reliably.
* dist.Makefile: Fixed distribution makefile to use the new system of 1
  large file.
* w3.el: Fixed problem with radio buttons - if more than one was set due
  to bad use of the CHECKED argument, then it would not let you turn one
  of them off.

Sat Jan 22 12:36:28 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Fixed problem where unknown tags in a <PRE> or <XMP> segment were
  getting nuked - bad when trying to show source code with < and > in them
  - large chunks would disappear.  Thanks to Magnus Y Alvestad
  <magnus@ii.uib.no> for noticing the problem.

* w3.el: Parse out mime-types file if it exists at startup.
* w3-epoch.el: Changed epoch to use the class name Emacs instead of emacs.

* w3-new-lucid.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-emacs19.el: Renamed a few menu items,
  and activated 'forward' and 'back' buttons.

  by Shin-ya Sato <sato@mahler.ntt.jp> for MULE support
* w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el: Removed reference to 'value' from
  w3-x-popup-menu - might not always be bound.
* w3-url.el: Changed newsgroup handling yet again - can now work with
  either Flee's nntp or the original nntp.el by Umeda.  No longer
  require's gnus.
* w3-new-lucid.el: Wrapped the make-pixmap call in a condition-case for
  safety.
* w3-epoch.el: Changed w3-insert-graphic to insert a '^' to attach the
  graphic to.
* w3-new-lucid.el: Changed w3-insert-graphic to create a larger extent
  instead of using '^' - looks much better now.
* w3-parse.el: Changed w3-handle-graphics to not insert a '^' for each
  graphic - leave that up to w3-insert-graphic if it needs it.

Mon Jan 17 22:32:40 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el: Added image/x-xbitmap to the list of graphics converters.
* w3-lists.el, w3-parse.el: Changed handling of <LI SRC> to only check if

  icons.
* w3-epoch.el: Cacheing of images will now only store the image once, not
  once for every time it is used.

  foreground and background color of the 'default face.
* w3-gopher.el: Gopher handling now spits out icons with appropriate ALT
  refs.
* w3-epoch.el: w3-insert-graphic is now only defined if epoch was compiled

* w3.el: Changed checking of efs/ange-ftp to also check for efs-auto
  before loading ange-ftp.
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el: Changed menu handling to
  ignore links with nil HREFs when making the 'links...' menu.
* w3-gopher.el: Changed w3-convert-ask-to-form for better handling of
  SELECT boxes that have no choices.
* w3.el: Added w3-leave-buffer.  Does a bury-buffer on the current buffer
  instead of killing it.
* w3-mime.el: Fixed problem where using telnet in a subprocess would chop
  off lots of front of incoming data.  Bad kill-line in
  w3-is-mime-response.
* w3-misc.el, w3-url.el, w3-viewers.el: Changed all yes-or-no-p/y-or-n-p
  functions to use the function specified by w3-confirmation-func

Thu Jan  6 23:58:37 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-gopher.el: Changed gopher parsing routines to print the type of the
  link in the listing.  The text describing the link is configurable by
  the variable w3-gopher-labels.
* w3-gopher.el: More tweaks for more mosaic-like behavior
* w3-parse.el: Searchable gopher objects no longer become inlined forms -
  selecting them creates the form, as in Mosaic.
* w3-gopher.el, w3-url.el: Switched gopher handling to use Mosaic's type
  of double-typing.  This makes it much easier to get searching done right
  (whether it needs a 7/ or not, etc).

Wed Jan  5 14:15:02 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-typecheck.el: Use new variable w3-passwd-entry-func instead of
  hard-coding ange-ftp-read-passwd.
* w3.el: Reworked some of w3-do-setup, and added comments
* w3.el: Changed to only require 'ange-ftp if not using efs.
* w3-lists.el: Did some work on the DL handling
* w3-url.el: Directory formatting routine will now include last file
  modification date and size if possible.  If not date data is returned by
  file-attributes, or current-time-string does not take a parameter, then
  no date is shown.  Size is usually shown (almost always if you use EFS
  instead of ange-ftp)
* w3.texi: Round and round he texinfo's, where he stops, noone knows.

Tue Jan  4 23:00:35 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-gopher.el: Fixed problem in handling of gopher text files . . . were
  always being parsed as HTML.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed dumb problem in encoding a gopher+ ASK form.
* w3.texi: Initial revision

Mon Jan  3 19:06:17 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* All files: Updated copyright notices
* w3-lists.el: UL and OL lists can now have <LI ALT="some text" SRC="some
  image">
* w3-misc.el: Renamed w3-rassq-with-equal to w3-rassoc
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el: Fixed stupid problem where I was trying to
  call the x-store-cut-buffer function even if not in X

Sun Jan  2 22:47:02 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el: Added a function to break up a menu description into smaller
  chunks and submenus.
* w3-gopher.el: Now smarter about when to parse out a gopher object as a
  directory listing
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el, w3-emacs.el, w3-epoch.el:
  Added function w3-store-in-x-clipboard
* w3.el: w3-save-url will now copy the url into the X clipboard
* w3.el: Added autoloads that autoload.el can understand.
* w3-forms.el: Forms links will now highlight when the mouse moves over
  them in lucid emacs (and any other flavor that eventually supports them
  in its version of w3-add-zone)
* w3-gopher.el: Fixed dumb problem where parts of the gopher+ selector
  string were being left in w3-current-file, so things like w3-view-url,
  etc were getting the wrong information.
* w3-gopher.el: Fixed stupid problem where I didn't convert the gopher
  selector strings into url encoding before creating the <A> tags in
  w3-format-gopher-link.  This caused gopher links with spaces/tabs/etc to
  not be parsed correctly.  Thanks to John Ladwig <jladwig@soils.umn.edu>
  for noticing the problem.

Sat Jan  1 20:08:19 1994  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el: Added support for showing some of the HTTP/1.0 headers in a
  buffer. Controlled by the new variable w3-show-headers.  Should be a
  list of HTTP/1.0 headers (all lowercase) to include at the end of the
  buffer. If nil, nothing will be shown.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for
  suggesting it.
* w3-gopher.el: Removed multiple definitions of w3-parse-gopher, and
  revamped the handling of gopher titles. 
* w3-misc.el: Changed w3-batch-fetch to be more robust - is now able to
  retrieve any type of information, and the user can specify whether they
  want formatted text, raw HTML, or transfer in binary mode.
* w3-parse.el: Changed the fill-column and <HR> calculation routines to
  honor the new variable w3-strict-width.
* w3-misc.el: Removed some useless variables from w3-get-url-at-point in
  the eternal quest for less compilation warnings.
* w3-misc.el: Fixed problem in w3-strip-leading-spaces and
  w3-eat-trailing-space
* w3-parse.el: The link building code will now remove all entity
  references in the link text before storing it in the zone - this means
  that the menu building code and w3-complete-link will no longer have
  unresolved entities in them looking nasty.
* w3-misc.el: Added function w3-fix-entities-in-string.  Takes any string
  and removes all entity references within it, and replaces it with normal
  text (uses the w3-html-entities assoc list).
* w3-new-lucid.el, w3-lucid.el: Added function w3-x-popup-dialog

Fri Dec 31 21:45:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-new-lucid.el, w3-lucid.el: Fixed problem in w3-fix-extent-endpoints
* w3-misc.el: Fixed problem in w3-eat-trailing-space that would always
  remove one too many spaces.
* w3-mosaic.el: Added function w3-rename-hotlist-entry to give a new title
  to an item in your hotlist.  Will not let you use a title that is
  already a member of the hotlist.
* w3-emacs19.el, w3-lucid.el, w3-new-lucid.el: Added a few options to the
  navigation menu
* w3-url.el: Added a patch from Fran Litterio <franl@centerline.com> that
  adds variable w3-reuse-buffers.  Also changed the buffer reusing code
  will skip over w3-working-buffer in its search for a matching url.
* w3-url.el: Fixed problem in passing things off to gopher-mode with blank
  selector strings - was not defining a good type (type was set to 0
  instead of ?1).
* w3-url.el: Fixed typo in gopher handling
* w3-gopher.el: Added % retrieved messages when retrieving a gopher+
  object, fixed problem in gopher parsing for emacs 19.

Thu Dec 30 23:58:19 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-gopher.el: Fixed dumb problem in gopher formatting - didn't check if
  the selector string was longer than 1 character before trying to extract
  the first char.
* w3-misc.el: Fixed major problems with w3-strip-leading-spaces and
  w3-eat-trailing-space again.
* w3-forms.el: Added support for submitting gopher+ ASK blocks
* w3-url.el: Changed gopher support/url parsing routines to handle gopher+
  and gopher ASK blocks without warping the URLs too much.
* w3-gopher.el: Added in gopher+ support
* w3.el: Fixed viewing of gopher links for new storage format.
* w3-gopher.el, w3-url.el: Revamping gopher

Thu Dec 30 13:57:53 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added support for Mule (Multi-Lingual Emacs), mainly highlighting of
  links.  Thanks to takada@seraph.ntt.jp for the patches.
* w3-next.el: Added provide 'w3-next
* w3-parse.el: Might have fixed the over-run into other words/spaces
  in link highlighting.

Wed Dec 29 23:33:07 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el: Added function w3-fetch-url-at-point... thanks to Torre
  J. Wenaus <wenaus@gem1.llnl.gov> for the code.
* w3-parse.el: Back to using window-width as starting point for
  w3-right-border.
* w3-vars.el: Removed variable w3-hypertext-extns
* w3-mosaic.el:  Removed support for adding old gopher-mode pages to
  the hotlist.  Trying to get people to use hypertext-gopher-mode.
* w3-next.el: Initial revision
* w3-gopher+.el: Added new function w3-convert-ask-to-form that
  converts a Gopher+ ASK block into an HTML form.
* w3-forms.el: Value and default value are now reset for each SELECT
  area in forms.
* w3-vars.el: Changed default gopher handling to be in hypertext.

Tue Dec 28 17:41:51 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Can now handle http:/somefile - it will substitute the
  server and port of the current document to make a complete url.
* w3-forms.el: Names in INPUT tags can be empty
* w3-auth.el, w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-forms.el,
  w3-lists.el, w3-mime.el, w3-misc.el, w3-parse.el, w3-typecheck.el,
  w3-url.el, w3-vars.el, w3.el: Removed lots of references to bound
  but unreferenced variables.
* w3-misc.el, w3-url.el, w3-vars.el, w3.el: Added new variables
  w3-mail-command and w3-mail-other-window-command. These variables
  will control what functions are called when w3 needs to send mail.
  W3 tries w3-mail-other-window-command only if w3-mutable-windows is
  t, then w3-mail-command if this function is not bound.  Then goes to
  mail-other-window, then just to mail.

Fri Dec 24 03:21:58 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Formatting directories now gives a progress indicator in
  % of files converted to hypertext listing.
* w3-url.el: Added code to check for whether a file is a symbolic
  link.  If it is, then put in an arrow and the name of the link (like
  ls -l).

Thu Dec 23 18:53:54 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-epoch.el, w3-misc.el, w3-parse.el, w3-typecheck.el, w3-vars.el:
  Replaced long regular expressions for checking whether a URL is
  relative  or not with a variable w3-nonrelative-link to save
  space/typing, and it will be easier to change in the future.
* w3-misc.el: Added function w3-batch-fetch to retrieve all the urls
  passed to it on the command line and save them as text files.
  Thanks to Jared Rhine for suggesting it.
* w3-parse.el: Removed use of screen-width/window-width when computing
  fill column.  Uses old value of fill-column.
* w3-mosaic.el: Fixed problem in new personal annotation parsing code
  that would barf if you didn't have any personal annotations.

Thu Dec 23 16:28:22 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el: Made lots of changes to the personal annotation
  handling.  Deletion will work properly now (won't mess up the
  internal representation of the annotations), support for the real
  Mosaic annotation format (more than one annotation on a url yields
  only one line in the annotation LOG file), figures out the highest
  annotation number instead of using the last line in the file +1.
* w3-emacs.el: Added definition of w3-create-faces.
* w3-gopher+.el: Initial revision
* w3-gopher.el: Fixed quite a few problems with gopher support.

Tue Dec 21 06:47:50 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el: Fixed idiotic problem where no PRE segments were being
  rendered.  *sigh*

Sat Dec 18 15:03:59 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el, w3-gopher.el, w3-forms.el: Added support for searching in
  gopher.  Transforms into a special type of form, like <ISINDEX>
  tags.  Only works if retrieved from a gopher listing right now.
* w3-vars.el: Changed default viewer for text/plain to be w3-mode
* w3-parse.el: Fixed problem with recursive filling of paragraphs - if
  there were too many <PRE> segments, then it would die from recursing
  too much. Thanks to Tom Tromey <tromey@busco.lanl.gov> for pointing
  out the problem.

Fri Dec 17 23:01:57 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Changed the display of XX of YY bytes transferred in
  HTTP/1.0 responses to be optional.  Would mess some people up that
  are behind gateways using telnet, etc.  Variable is
  w3-show-http2-transfer.
* w3-lists.el: Added support for <LI SRC="blahblahblah"> for list
  items with icons, etc.
* w3-epoch.el:  Rewrote the resource fetching routines to me
  consistent with emacs 19 and lucid emacs.
* w3-lucid.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-new-lucid.el: Moved all
  face creation stuff into w3-create-faces.
* w3-vars.el: Fixed typo in w3-graphic-converter-alist
* w3-vars.el: Added keybindings > & < to go to end/beginning of
  document.  Added functions w3-end-of-document and
  w3-start-of-document to go the end and beginning of a document
  respectively.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed a problem in the new text area support.
* w3-forms.el, w3-typecheck.el: Reworked quite a bit of stuff to get
  forms submissions working correctly. You no longer have to keep
  buffers around until you submit the form, and the default text (or
  the current value of the button) is inserted each time you edit the
  form area.
* w3-mime.el:  Changed w3-parse-mime-viewers to split the Accept:
  string onto one or more lines as appropriate, as the NCSA server
  doesn't seem to like the long Accept: line when POSTing a form.
* w3.el: Merged in support for NeXT emacs from Laurent Dami
  <dami@cui.unige.ch> (emacs 18.58 on NeXTstep)
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-lucid.el,
  w3-new-lucid.el: Added function w3-setup-version-specifics that will
  do any required fiddling for each version of emacs.

Thu Dec 16 23:22:08 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-new-lucid.el: Fixed problem with w3-fix-extent-endpoints failing
  when an extent was completey spaces/newlines
* w3-forms.el: Changed regular expressions to allow one or more =
  signs in name/value tags.
* w3-forms.el: Made input tags with NAME of isindex do an automatic
  submission, ala Mosaic, and marca@ncsa.uiuc.edu's suggestion on
  www-talk that browsers should standardize on this hack.
* w3-parse.el: Changed form-based searching to use an input tag of
  NAME isindex like Mosaic.
* w3-parse.el: Fixed error in new header routines. Would bomb if a
  header was not terminated correctly.
* w3-parse.el: No longer remove tabs at the beginning of the buffer -
  was messing up lists.  Still removes spaces/newlines
* w3-forms.el, w3-parse.el: Added real support for TEXTAREA tags, and
  wrap TEXTAREA input tags in PRE segments.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed bad regular expression in forms mode that would
  cause tags with VALUE="" to be drawn wrong.
* w3-newparse.el, w3-url.el: Use new function w3-lazy-message instead
  of message.  Will not update the modeline if called more than once a
  second.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski <jwz@lucid.com> for the patches.
* w3-viewers.el: Starting viewers no longer starts an interactive
  shell & exec.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski for showing me that it was a
  dumb thing to do :)
* w3-new-lucid.el: Initial revision
* w3-vars.el, w3.el, w3-lists.el: Changed occurences of w3-running-era
  to w3-running-new-lucid
* w3.el: Moved creation of w3-mime-accept-string into w3-do-setup
* w3-epoch.el: Fixed problem in epoch form entry.
* w3-forms.el: Changed assignment to free variable method in w3-handle-forms.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed the revert button bugs in emacs 19.
* w3-emacs19.el: changed w3-delete-zone to use remove-text-properties
  instead of putting nil text properties.
* w3-emacs19.el: Changed w3-delete-zone to remove the face and
  mouse-face properties. 

Wed Dec 15 22:56:43 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lists.el: Added a 't' to calls to replace-match so that the case
  is preserved.
* w3-vars.el: Added variable w3-list-chars-assoc for specifying what
  characters to insert at the front of lists.
* w3-lists.el: Can now control what characters are inserted at the
  front of a list. See w3-list-chars-assoc for details.

Wed Dec 15 20:41:02 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Version 1.7.14
* w3-forms.el: Fixed problem with resetting popdown menus to the
  defaults.
* w3-epoch.el: Rewrote w3-fix-extent-endpoints to remove
  newlines/whitespace from front of zones also, as well as numbers &
  periods.  This will fix lists, but might mess up real links once in a
  while.  Oh well, epoch won't be around much longer anyway.
* w3-mosaic.el: Fixed bug in w3-write-global-history where 'nil' in
  the history would cause it to choke.  Thanks to franl@centerline.com
  for noticing the problem.
* w3-emacs.el: Changed the w3-fix-extent-endpoints to remove
  newlines/whitespace from the front of zones also.
* w3-lists.el: Changed the list handling code to use
  insert-before-markers if using emacs 18.  This keeps the
  indentation/numbering to not become part of the zones.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed a few errors with the new forms/link movement
  code
* w3-emacs19.el: Changed w3-follow-link to not die on links with no
  data.
* w3-emacs19.el: Changed w3-forward-link and w3-back-link to honor
  forms entry areas.
* w3-vars.el: Changed definition of w3-header-char-assoc to use BR correctly
* w3-parse.el: <BR> tags are rendered a little better now - no extra
  spaces from the fill-region will make them look odd.
  
Tue Dec 14 21:41:29 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Added checking to w3-fetch to see if a buffer visiting a
  URL already exists before fetching it.  Offers to reuse the old one if
  found.
* w3.el: Changed w3-save-url to be more consistent with the other
  commands that muck with URLs.  C-k grabs the current URL into the kill
  ring, and C-k with a prefix arg grabs the URL under pt into the kill
  ring.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for pointing out the inconsistency.
* w3-mosaic.el: Added function w3-append-hotlist.  This will append a
  hotlist to the one currently in memory.
* w3-parse.el: Fixed problem where <P> breaks after a header item were
  not being erased.
* w3-misc.el: Added function w3-upcase-region that will convert a
  region of text to uppercase, but ignore any text in it that is between
  < and >.  This will stop it from changing the links references within
  <A> tags.
* w3-vars.el: Changed the header assoc list to use w3-upcase-region
  instead of upcase region.  Was causing links in headers to point to
  the wrong files.
* w3-era.el, w3-lucid.el: Added patch from Alastair Burt that fixes a
  few problems in the lucid menu handling code (malformed, plus trims
  the menu items to w3-lucid-max-item-size so that they don't shoot off
  the sides of your screen.
* w3-url.el: Added a space at the end of the prompt in w3-open-local
* w3.el: Changed w3-reload-document so that it remembers where you
  were in the buffer and repositions you there.
* w3-mime.el: Changed the format of w3-mime-accept-string so that it
  can be used in other places.
* w3-misc.el: Added functions w3-forward-in-history and
  w3-backward-in-history.  This will first try to find the actual buffer
  recorded in the history list, then any buffer with the same URL, then
  goes to point in those buffers.
* w3-vars.el: Added new variable w3-current-next-link and
  w3-current-last-link that are buffer-local.  These store the history
  information for this buffer.
* w3.el: Changed a few functions to use the new history mechanism
* w3-url.el: Modified w3-fetch to store history items in the new
  variables
  
Mon Dec 13 23:39:20 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs.el: Finished function w3-fix-extent-endpoints, but need to
  do something about the markers moving in front of list items.
  w3-fix-extent-startpoints or something similar.
* w3-lucid.el: Added missing function 'w3-delete-zone Fixed menu
  generation error
* w3-misc.el: Changed w3-maybe-relative and a few other functions to
  take an optional 'DATA' parameter for using the POST command,etc.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed a few problems with non-POSTing forms submissions
* w3-parse.el: Removed code to eat newlines/whitespace at the
  beginning/end of links.  Was causing errors if links were within PRE
  segmens (actually, only if a link was the last thing in a PRE segment,
  and it had whitespace after it, and before the </PRE>
* w3-forms.el: Fixed problem with forms <SELECTION MULTIPLE> support.
  Wasn't giving the fake checkboxes any 'value's, so it was reported as
  'ON' to the server, not the name of what was selected.  Also fixed a
  problem where the option variable in SELECTION handling wasn't being
  set to nil each time, so each successive SELECTION tag would get more
  and more choices.
* w3-parse.el: Added call to function w3-fix-extent-endpoints.  Should
  fix the problem with forms eating newlines/spaces at the end of form
  entry areas when new data is entere.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed problem in forms submission.  Would die if the
  first item in a form was a SELECTION - it was not storing the
  method/actionurl if it was.

Sun Dec 12 20:54:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-epoch.el: Added function w3-fix-extent-endpoints
* w3-emacs.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-era.el, w3-lucid.el: Added new
  function w3-fix-extent-endpoints.  Makes extents smaller if they have
  newlines/whitespace at the end.  This will keep the forms support from
  killing newlines whenever you do a form entry.
* w3-cache.el: Added code to store stuff in cache as compressed
  (gzipped) data.
* w3-url.el: HTTP links like http://cs.indiana.edu are now recognized
  (no longer needs the trailing '/'
* w3-lists.el: Fixed problem where alternating <P> tags would
  disappear within lists.  Over-aggressive regular expression.
* w3-url.el: Changed the handling of content-length - using
  w3-parse-mime-headers was causing an infinite loop in redirection.
* w3-mime.el: Fixed a few problems in the redirection handling because
  of switching to lower-case headers in w3-current-mime-headers.
* w3-url.el: Added support for using the content-length header in
  HTTP/1.0 responses to show how big the file is in the minibuffer.
* w3-mime.el: Changed the MIME parsing routines to save the header
  fields in lowercase.
* w3-emacs.el: Fixed dumb problem in w3-complete-link for emacs 18.
  Left out a call to w3-zone-data.
* w3-url.el, w3-forms.el: Replaced use of member with w3-member.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed error in regular expression where buttons with
  spaces in their VALUE fields would not be rendered.
* w3-viewers.el: New way to specify whether to view process output or
  not.  w3-working-buffer is always destroyed if a viewer is invoked.
* w3-vars.el: Added variable w3-always-show-output.
* w3-vars.el: Changed def. of &yuml; to be ?\377 instead of the actual
  character 377.  Was causing problems with CVS.
* w3-parse.el: Whitespace at the beginning of buffers will now be
  erased.  Headers will now be a little more intelligent about how they
  do line/paragraph breaks.  Headers can now be shown on text terminals
  by the variable w3-header-chars-assoc.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for the
  suggestion.
* w3-parse.el: Added support for user-customizable text before and
  after headers
* w3-misc.el: Changed w3-eat-trailing-spaces and
  w3-strip-leading-spaces to get ride of newlines too.
* w3-vars.el: Added the variable w3-header-chars-assoc to have
  formatting of headers on dumb terminals.

Fri Dec 10 21:14:07 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lists.el: Fixed bug where lowercase list tags (ol instead of OL)
  would cause an infinite loop if there were within another list.  Left
  out an (upcase (..))
  
Thu Dec  9 23:24:10 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: Changed the handling of MULITPLE selections in option
  lists to be a <UL> of the options, all checkboxes with the same name.

Wed Dec  8 22:46:07 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lists.el: Fixed a bug where PRE segments within lists would be
  ignored and filled.
* w3-forms.el: Added support for the SEVERAL/MULTIPLE attribute on the
  SELECT input tag.  Rendered as a preformatted list of checkboxes.
* w3-misc.el: Added function w3-eat-trailing-space
* w3-mime.el: Fixed a dumb problem where I forgot a "%s" in a format
  string and so wasn't sending any data during a POST forms submission
* w3-forms.el: Added support for POST submission of forms
* w3-mime.el: Added a 'data' field to the w3-create-mime-request
  function.  This will make it easy to implement post in a more
  generalized way later.
* w3-url.el: Added ability to send arbitrary data down through
  w3-fetch, w3-retrieve, and w3-http.  Useful for POST method.
* w3-emacs19.el: Removed patch for double-skipping of links in early
  versions of emacs.  People using < 19.21 should upgrade.
* w3-lists.el: Nested lists should now be a little quicker.  Also
  fixed the problem where paragraphs within lists would have an extra
  space at the beginning of the first line.
* w3-forms.el: Changed w3-do-form-entry to do w3-delete-zone before
  deleting the text contained by the zone.  Previous behavior would make
  emacs19 bomb with an error.
* w3-typecheck.el: Changed the option reading so that it checks
  whether w3-x-popup-menu returns a cons pair or a plain string and acts
  accordingly.
* w3-docomp.el: Added lots of autoloads to get rid of compilation errors
* w3-mime.el: Changed the header parsing to get _ALL_ the headers and
  store them in an assoc list instead of just getting the 3 or 4 I need
  now.  Will make it easier to expand on later when the HTTP/1.0 spec
  grows.
* w3-vars.el: New variable w3-current-mime-headers, which is an assoc
  list of MIME headers for each document.
* w3-url.el: Changed w3-retrieve so that if a response it not an
  HTTP/1.0 response, add its name to w3-bad-server-list if it is not
  already a 'member'.
* w3-mime.el: Added support for the new '204 NoResponse' HTTP/1.0
  response.  No new document is displayed.

Tue Dec  7 21:09:21 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: Some revisions to try and make the radio button
  toggling faster.  Will now only change the radio button(s) that are
  set to be off, and the one that is supposed to be on, on.
* w3-lucid.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-era.el, w3-emacs19.el: Added function
  w3-zone-eq
* w3-era.el: Fixed typo in w3-zone-data that was causing forms to
  screw up.
* w3-forms.el, w3-newparse.el: Use 'intern' instead of read
* w3-emacs19.el: Removed the local-map from the text properties.  Put
  it in the distribution by mistake.
* w3-emacs19.el: applied patch from <michalj@fuw.edu.pl> to fix
  skipping 2 links when going backwards.
* w3-html+.el: Fixed a missing ) or two
* w3-cache.el: Initial revision
* w3-vars.el: Added variables for document caching.
* w3-html+.el: Trying to get tables working better

Mon Dec  6 23:04:01 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-era.el: Fixed dumb error where w3-follow-link would try to fetch
  the text of the link, not the url of the link.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed a few things with the new text properties
  support.
* w3-forms.el: Removed reference to free variable prompt in
  w3-do-form-entry.  Cut & pasted a few too many lines.
* w3-forms.el: Changed all the form handling routines that reformatted
  the buffer to use w3-form-format-<input-tag-type> instead of reusing
  the code.  Was causing some inconsistent redraws.  Thanks to Arup
  Mukherjee <arup@cs.cmu.edu> for noticing the problem.
* w3-parse.el: Styles will now work again in epoch.  Needed to
  re-apply a patch that got lost in a hard drive crash.  Thanks to Henry
  A. Rowley <har@cs.cmu.edu> for the patch.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed problem in the making of menus.  Had a (list
  ...) that included the 'displayable' option in the menu vectors.
  Thanks to Jorge Sousa Pinto <mesjsp@di.uminho.pt> for noticing the
  problem.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed a cut&paste error - multiply defined functions
  and a lot of typos in w3-complete-link
* w3-misc.el: Added function w3-strip-leading-spaces
* w3-era.el: Changed the w3-complete-link routine to strip spaces from
  the front of links so that all of them will be visible.
* w3-lucid.el, w3-epoch.el, w3-emacs19.el, w3-emacs.el: Changed the
  w3-complete-link routine to strip spaces from the front of links so
  that all of them will be visible.
* w3-vars.el: A few revisions to the default settings of
  w3-style-chars-assoc
* w3-vars.el: Added the variables w3-style-chars-assoc and
  w3-delimit-emphasis for doing text-based markup.
* w3-parse.el: Added the ability to have characters that define the
  start and end of a region of formatting (ie: * surrounds bold text, _
  surrounds underlined text, etc).  Controlled by w3-style-chars-assoc
  and w3-delimit-emphasis variables.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for
  suggesting it.

Sun Dec  5 21:38:23 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: fixed typo in w3-open-local-internal.
* w3-url.el: Disabled use of w3-be-asynchronous for now
* w3-era.el: Enabling/disabling of Era menus now cleaner than in lucid
* w3.el: Menus will now be created when running in Era
* w3-vars.el: Added face-specific stuff for Era, and modified the
  default value of w3-delimit-links to take the w3-running-era variable
  into account.
* w3-vars.el: Better checking of the various w3-running-* variables.
  I long for the day when they will all merge. :)
* w3-era.el: Added support for 'viewing' a form entry area with
  w3-view-this-url Will message the name and type of the form entry
  area, but returns nil if called with no-show 't'.
* w3-era.el: More changes to be era-specific
* w3-era.el: Basic switch to era-specific functions from the lucid
  cust. file
* w3-epoch.el: Added alias w3-delete-zone (to epoch::delete-zone)
* w3-emacs19.el: Added function w3-delete-zone
* w3-forms.el: Use function w3-delete-zone instead of a large (cond
  (...)) for using delete-zone, etc.  Easier to add support for new
  flavors of emacs.
* w3-vars.el: Added the variable w3-running-era
* w3.el: Added loading of specific routines for 'era' - the
  epoch/lucid merge
* w3-era.el: Initial revision
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed a problem in w3-only-links that would return
  the wrong position if the link was only one character long.
* w3-misc.el: Added the function w3-reload-all-files.  This will
  remove all the 'features' 'provided by w3, and then do a (require 'w3)
  so that the files will all be reloaded.
* w3-mime.el: Changed the w3-is-mime-response function so that it will
  remove the HTTP/1.0 request if it has been echoed to the screen,
  either by telnet or by the tcp.el emulation package.  Thanks to
  everyone who reported the bug.
* w3-parse.el: Moved handling of telnet header lines into
  w3-is-mime-response
* w3-emacs19.el: Believe I have fixed the w3-complete-links to work
  with the new use of text properties instead of overlays.  This should
  fix the problem of the links menu not showing up in X also.  Thanks to
  T V Raman <raman@cs.cornell.edu> for noticing it was broken.
* w3-mime.el: Framework for '204 No Response' put in
* w3-auth.el: Removed function w3-encode-password, and put the code
  into the actual w3-basic-auth, since future versions will probably use
  different encodings for the username/password pair.

Sat Dec  4 12:54:43 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@monolith)
* w3-forms.el (w3-handle-selections): Added <OPTION SELECTED> support.
  Thanks to Darrell Kindred for telling me to do it.
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mime-headers): Fixed a problem where redirection of
  URLS would lose the content-type and other headers of the URL it was
  redirected to.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for noticing the problem.
* w3-forms.el (w3-do-form-entry): Fixed a problem where form submission
  buffers would not stay on top of the buffer stack.  Moved the submit
  code outside the save-excursion.  Thanks to Darrell Kindred for the
  suggestion on how to fix it.
* w3-lists.el (w3-fill-paragraphs-in-list): Dumb problem with too many
  newlines in paragraphs within lists.  Thanks to Jared Rhine for noticing
  the problem.
* w3-parse.el (w3-fix-paragraphs): Fixed a problem where paragraphs before
  the last <HR> in a buffer were not filled.  Thanks to Jared Rhine and
  Darrell Kindred for fixes.
* w3-typecheck.el (w3-read-correct-format): Added a default type checker
  for unknown tag types.
* w3-emacs19.el (w3-follow-link): This no longer signals an error if there
  is no link under point.
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mime-headers): Changed the regexp to extract the
  Location header from an HTTP/1.0 response so that newlines are stripped
  from it correctly.  Thanks to Darrell Kindred for sending me the patch.
* w3-misc.el (w3-open-stream): Added a pause in when connections failed.
  Thanks to Jost Krieger <Jost.Krieger@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> for
  suggesting it.
* w3-emacs.el (w3-add-zone): Fixed a problem in normal emacs where
  highlighted text <CODE>TEXT</CODE> would be interpreted as a link.
  Thanks to T V Raman <raman@cs.cornell.edu> for noticing the problem.
* w3-vars.el (w3-mime-extensions): Changed the default MIME content type
  to be text/html so that pages like http://cs.indiana.edu/ will be
  formatted when they don't have a file extension.
* w3-forms.el: Applied a path from Darrell Kindred that fixed some very
  odd radio button behavior.
* w3-forms.el: Believe I have fixed the problem in lucid emacs where
  choosing a form entry box would eat the character immediately after the
  input tag.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed a regexp that would gobble newlines/paragraph breaks
  after an input tag.  Thanks to Skip Montanaro
  <montanaro@ausable.crd.ge.com> for noticing the problem.
* w3-lists.el: Dumb error in a regexp that would make all <DL> lists
  disappear was fixed.
* w3-lists.el: Added roman numeral handing to ordered lists.  Thanks to
  Tom Loos (tloos@indiana.edu) for explaining the algorithm and writing
  some C code I could translate into lisp.

Fri Dec  3 12:04:18 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lucid.el: Fixed stupid problem where going backwards by 1 link always
  took you to the first link of a buffer.   Mispaced ) in
  w3-previous-extent. 
* w3-emacs19.el: Changed everything to use text-properties instead of
  overlays.
* w3-emacs19.el (w3-add-zone): Added preliminary support for just typing
  into the emacs19 forms.  Will talk to jwz about adding this
  functionality to lucid emacs.

Wed Dec  1 08:05:02 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-newparse.el: Created this file - has new parsing routines.  Very
  experimental.  Don't use unless you want it to choke, and then figure
  out why it choked. :)

Fri Nov 26 03:52:19 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: Changed the forms handling routines so that it handles
  METHOD, ACTION, and ENCTYPE attributes of the <FORM> tag.  METHOD and
  ENCTYPE aren't used yet.  Thanks to Darrell Kindred for noticing the
  problem.
* w3-parse.el: Fixed a formatting problem with the ISINDEX forms
  replacements.  Was doing a fixed-case replace.  Thanks to Jared Rhine
  <Jared_Rhine@hmc.edu> for noticing the problem.
* w3-parse.el: Fixed a formatting error with <BR> tags - sometimes spaces
  were left at the beginning of the continued line.  Thanks to Erich
  Schneider  <erich@bush.cs.tamu.edu> for noticing the problem.
* w3-misc.el (w3-lookup-style): Fixed dumb bug where I was not
  de-referencing the variables to the actual #<style> value in epoch.
  Thanks to Paul Furnanz <paul_furnanz@mentorg.com> for the initial fix.
  I generalized it a little.
* w3-parse.el: Added a check to make sure that long URLs don't show up as
  extremely long buffer names.  Thanks to Heiko Muenkel
  <muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de> for noticing the problem.
* w3-lucid.el: Added a patch from Sjoerd Mullender
  <Sjoerd.Mullender@cwi.nl> to add a menu bar to lucid emacs if there
  wasn't one by default.
* w3-emacs19.el: Added a few patches from Jin S Choi (jsc@mit.edu).
  Mostly fixed the hotlist menu updating code, as well as a few cosmetic
  changes to the FSF19 menus.
* w3-epoch.el: Added a few patches from Henry Rowley <har@cs.cmu.edu> to
  fix a few functions that assumed epoch was compiled with
  add-graphic-zone.
* w3-lists.el (w3-fill-paragraphs-in-list): Fixed a stupid bug where the
  first letter of every paragraph would be removed when filling.  Thanks
  to Arup Mukherjee <arup@cmu.edu> for noticing the problem, and Darrell
  Kindred for the fix.

Tue Nov 16 10:55:56 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Makefile (install): Fixed problem where I was only copying W3FILES to
  the install directory, and should have used W3FILES and W3BINS.
* w3-forms.el: Stupid problem where I was always trying to call
  w3-form-format-unknown.  Simple 'not' around a statement to fix.
* w3-forms.el: Yet another stupid typo - w3-format-unkown instead of
  w3-format-unknown.  Thanks to Dan Sullivan
  <sullivan@quinn.physics.ncsu.edu> for the fix.

Mon Nov 15 21:02:50 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Various small changes (wrote over the new ChangeLog when doing a restore
  of some files).
* w3-vars.el: Changed the order of w3-html-entities so that &amp; is at
  the end.  This was causing the entities later in the list to be messed
  up if they occurred in the same document.
* w3-lucid.el: Changed the w3-extent-at, w3-find-specific-link, and
  w3-next-extent to not use a free variable.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinksi
  <jwz@lucid.com> for the patch.  Dumb oversite on my part.
* w3-forms.el: Made the forms formatting very extensible.  The formatting
  function is determined by reading in lisp expression from a formatted
  string.  w3-form-format-<type> will now be called and expected to return
  a string to use as the prompt.
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed dumb problem where emacs19 on a tty would not be
  able to find a list of links in the current document for
  w3-complete-link.
* w3-lists.el: Fixed the filling of paragraphs within lists.  No longer
  inserts too many newlines.
* Fixed a few problems where w3-do-setup was not being called correctly at
  startup.  This would result in an error about w3-style-regexp being nil.
* w3-mosaic.el: Fixed a problem with the hotlist handling code.  Mistake
  in a regular expression.  Thanks to Jin S Choi (jsc@mit.edu) for
  reporting the problem and sending a fix.

Fri Nov 12 07:31:36 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: The mailcap entries are now parsed at startup.
* Made changes to several files so that the new NeXTstep port of emacs 19
  will use faces, and not think its on a dumb terminal.  Mostly involved
  changing a bunch of (eq window-system 'x) to an or (eq window-system
  'dps).  While I was at it I also changed the statements so that the
  Presentation Manager port of emacs 19 under OS/2 will use faces, etc.

Thu Nov 11 07:20:13 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Realized I should get sick more often - I seem to get more done. :)
* w3-vars.el: Added the ABSTRACT, QUOTE, and BYLINE tags to the list of
  emphasis tags.
* w3-parse.el (w3-handle-notes): Added support for the HTML+ NOTE tags.
  Handles any role, and also honors the SRC= for the warning image.
* w3-parse.el (w3-handle-footnotes): Added support for the HTML+ footnote
  and margin-note tags.  Handles as links to footnotes at the end of the
  document. 
* w3-parse.el (w3-fix-render-hints): Added support for the HTML+ RENDER
  tag to extend the set of logical emphasis roles on a per-document basis.
* w3-parse.el: Changed the emphasis handling to be more extensible.  New
  variables w3-style-assoc and w3-style-regexp.  w3-style-assoc maps tags
  onto style names.
* w3-parse.el: Added ability to have IDS within headers.   This is in
  conformance with the HTML+ specification.
* w3-lists.el: Added ability to have IDs within <P> tags.  This is in
  conformance with the HTML+ specification.
* w3-lists.el: Added function w3-fill-paragraphs-in-list.  This will fill
  all paragraphs within any type of list.  This allows for <P> elements
  within lists without odd looking results.
* w3-forms.el (w3-split): Changed this so that it no longer puts strings
  with only spaces and tabs in the assoc list that is returned.  This
  error caused every popup FORM item to have a blank line at the end.
* Added new variable w3-default-action.  This specifies the lisp function
  to run instead of w3-prepare-buffer when W3 can't figure out the MIME
  type by looking at the file extension.  (Things like .README or .patch
  would be parsed as HTML - not good).  Thanks to Alastair Burt
  <burt@dfki.uni-kl.de> for noticing the problem.

Wed Nov 10 08:02:31 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* General cleanup, better documentation in all files.  Trying to merge
  files so that there are fewer dependencies between files.  Thank
  goodness for the optimizing byte compiler and call-trees. :)
* w3-parse.el: Removed the handling of <EM> tags.  No longer part of the
  HTML+ specification.
* w3-vars.el: Excercise in anal-retentiveness. :)  Organized and
  alphabetized all the variables and added to quite a few documentation
  strings.  Yeah yeah yeah, but it needed it! :)
* w3-vars.el: Added a few more new keybindings from Tom Tromey
  <tromey@busco.lanl.gov>.
* w3-misc.el (w3-maybe-eval): Added new MIME type application/emacs-lisp
  along with a viewer that asks whether to evaluate it after viewing it.
* w3-url.el (w3-open-local): Made this a stub to call w3-fetch with file:
  prepended to the filename you type in.  w3-open-local-internal now does
  all the work.  Thanks to Bill Benedetto <benedett@gentire.com> for
  noticing it was bombing out when called non-interactively.
* w3-url.el (w3-news): Added the ability to specify a news server in the
  news url in the proposed news://server:port/article|newsgroup method.
* w3-typecheck.el (w3-optionp): Changed this to correctly handle when you
  don't select anything from the menu.  Would mess up the page and remove
  the link before dying on an error.  Thanks to Jin S. Choi <jsc@mit.edu>
  for noticing the problem.

Tue Nov  9 14:59:59 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-file): Added proper handling of ftp://user@host commands.
* w3-forms.el (w3-revert-form): Fixed this function so it will work if
  there are pull-down lists in the form.  Also changed the forms parsing
  code to use the first item in a list as the default.
* w3-forms.el (w3-submit-form): TEXTAREA's will now be submitted
  correctly.  The buffer containing the information you typed in must not
  be killed though.  I need to find a better way to store it.  Maybe a new
  major mode?  But then how to relay the info back to the w3-typecheck
  function as the value?

Mon Nov  8 13:05:29 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added function w3-complete-link to do a completing-read on all the links
  in a buffer.  Should work in all emacsen.
* Changed printing, saving, and mailing of documents so that you can
  print/mail/save LaTeX, formatted text, or HTML source.
* w3-url.el, w3-gopher.el: Changed the reading.... messages to display the
  actual number of bytes retrieved.

Sun Nov  7 11:37:53 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-http): Fixed a problem where fetching something that had a
  viewer associated with it when the connection was down or the file was
  not found would still drop you into the viewer... often with odd
  results.
* w3-lucid.el: Fixed a few bugs in the new lucid menus - was adding a nil
  menu item (buffers with no links, no hotlist in memory, etc).  Caused
  system crashes on linux, headaches on other operating systems.  Thanks
  to Alastair Burt <burt@dfki.uni-kl.de> and Arup Mukherjee
  <arup@KALI.FTM.CS.CMU.EDU> for noticing the problem and for the initial
  patches.
* w3-mosaic.el: Think I fixed a problem with the hotlist parsing code.
  Thanks to Jin S. Choi <jsc@slayer.mit.edu> for noticing the problem.

Wed Nov  3 21:35:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lucid.el: Completely reworked the menu setup.  Several different
  menus, mirroring the setup of Xmosaic.
* w3-vars.el: Assigned a few new keybindings to make w3 a little closer to
  info mode.  Also redefined the M-C-v and M-b keys to use the C-c prefix
  as they should.

Mon Nov  1 09:42:18 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Changed this so that it no longer
  puts the delimiters around links with no HREFs. Thanks to Ivan Herman
  <Ivan.Herman@cwi.nl> for noticing that it was still broken.
* w3-epoch.el (w3-insert-graphic): Changed this function to redirect
  the output into the file instead of outputting it to STDOUT and then
  saving it in a buffer and then writing the buffer.  Faster,
  especially for large files, and don't have to worry about how many
  lines to delete at the top of the buffer.

Sun Oct 31 10:31:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Think I've fixed the problem of
  links in headers being formatted with newlines.
* w3.el (w3-parse-relative-link): Fixed a problem where links of the
  type "#something" would retrieve the current directory.  Stupid
  mistake.  Thanks to Ivan.Herman@cwi.nl for noticing it.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed quite a few problems with the Emacs 18 support.
  Problem was with using markers as start and end positions to
  creating new zones - they got set to nil when the whole region was
  deleted, so subsequent delete-regions failed.  This also caused a
  problem when trying to use the submit or reset buttons.
* w3-typecheck.el (w3-read-correct-format): Fixed a problem with the
  pulldown menu support in emacs 18.  The last-input-event variable
  doesn't exist, so wrapped its use in an if boundp ..., etc.
* w3-gopher.el (w3-do-gopher): Fixed problem where links like
  gopher://somesite/11/etc/etc/ would not get parsed - was seeing 11
  and thinking it wasn't a directory.
* w3-url.el (w3-gopher): Fixed a problem where a match-beginning got
  lost because of a misplaced w3-unhex-string.  Thanks to   Arup
  Mukherjee <arup@cmu.edu> for noticing the problem.
* w3-emacs.el: Changed the forward and backward link handling code so
  that it will skip white space at the beginning of a link.  Thanks to
  Arup Mukherjee <arup@cmu.edu> for noticing the problem.
* w3-parse.el (w3-handle-comments): Fixed this function to handle either
  comments written according to the HTML spec (with a trailing -->) or the
  Xmosaic-handled way (with no --).  Thanks to Darrell Kindred
  <dkindred@KALI.FTM.CS.CMU.EDU> for noticing the problem.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-parse-hotlist): Applied a patch by Arup Mukherjee
  <arup@cmu.edu> and Darrell Kindred <dkindred@KALI.FTM.CS.CMU.EDU> to fix
  an annoying problem where the first page you retrieved in a w3 session
  would not be shown, and the buffer you started out in would be put into
  w3-mode.

Sat Oct 30 13:38:43 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el (w3-preview-this-buffer): Fixed this so that it does a
  buffer-file-name instead of just buffer-name so that it will be able
  to reload documents correctly.
* w3-epoch.el: Fixed stupid problem in w3-follow-link where it called
  w3-do-form-entry with the arguments in the wrong order.
* w3-emacs19.el: Removed requirement of cl.  Took up lots of space - was
  old anyway.  'last' is no longer needed.
* Applied patches to Makefile from Jamie Zawinskie <jwz@lucid.com> so it
  will compile in a better way.
* Added full GNU copyleft notice to all the source files so that it can be
  distributed with Lucid Emacs.  Also changed lots of functions to make the
  files compile with fewer warnings about unbound variables.

Wed Oct 27 07:10:56 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el (w3-handle-selections): Added this function to handle the
  new <SELECT> tag in HTML+.  Supercedes the TYPE="OPTION" tag.  This also
  handles the scrolling list boxes and multiple pick lists.  Multiple pick
  lists don't work correctly yet though.
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mailcap): New function to parse the .mailcap file
  used by Mosaic/metamail/etc.  Appends it to the w3-mime-viewers assoct
  list - format is preserved correctly.  If the MIME type is already in
  the assoc list, then it is skipped.

Tue Oct 26 08:39:23 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-epoch.el (w3-follow-link): Fixed a problem where w3-follow-link
  would not work correctly - needed to wrap the 't' start of an if
  statement with a progn.
* w3-epoch.el (w3-create-hrule): Created this function to generate a
  pixmap the size of the current window width to use for horizontal
  rules.  Also changed the parser to use add-graphic-zone if it is in
  epoch and it finds an <HR>, otherwise it will use the dashes.

Mon Oct 25 17:15:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-vars.el (w3-mime-extensions): Added _LOTS_ more MIME types +
  descriptions of _ALL_ of them.
* w3-lucid.el (w3-mouse-handler): Changed this to use the new function
  w3-link-info.  Is a little easier to use.
* w3-misc.el (w3-link-info): New function to give an intelligent guess of
  what the link is pointing to.  ie: 'A hypertext file on the local file
  system' or 'A newsgroup (comp.infosystems.www) from NNTP server
  usenet.ucs.indiana.edu'
* w3-url.el (w3-open-local): Fixed a problem where opening a local file as
  ~/..../fname.html would cause an error if you had a relative reference
  past the ~/ point.  Thanks to Benjamin Pierce <bcp@dcs.ed.ac.uk> for
  noticing the problem.
* w3.el (w3-search): Changed this function to make sure that only 1 '?' is
  appeneded to the url when searching.  Thanks to Arup Mukherjee
  <arup@cmu.edu> for noticing the problem.

Sat Oct 23 10:25:32 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-epoch.el: Fixed w3-follow-link so it will work again - was
  messing up once in a while because of the new code to let images be
  used as links.
* w3-epoch.el: Using images as links should work now.  Need to have it
  check for failure of reading the XPM and use the ALT attribute if it
  does.
* w3-url.el (w3-format-news): Fixed this function so that it will no
  longer call w3-sentinel on its own.  Also changed it so that the <TITLE>
  is set to the subject, not the newsgroup name.
* w3-epoch.el: redid the image code to limit the images to 40 colors.
  This allows more images to be read in before the conversions start
  failing.  Can change this arbitrary limit by changing the argument
  to ppmquant in w3-graphic-converter-alist.
* w3-misc.el (w3-hexify-string): Fixed this function - it would mess
  up when sending hex codes < F.  (ie: %F instead of %0F).

Fri Oct 22 12:37:26 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Removed all the references to &optional source in all the
  different retrieval areas (w3-http, w3-file, w3-gopher, etc).  This will
  all be handled in w3-build-continuation from now on.  Also changed it so
  that printing/sourcing a document doesn't explicitly set the w3-source
  variable or w3-print-next, it just wraps the calls to w3-sentinel in a
  let statement.
* w3-url.el (w3-http): Changed w3-http to insert an error message into
  w3-working-buffer if it couldn't connect to the server.  Thanks to 
  Bengt Andersson <Bengt.Andersson@telelogic.se> for noticing the problem.

Thu Oct 21 06:31:09 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mime-headers): Changed the detection of circular
  redirection to insert a warning at the end of whatever it did retrieve
  instead of signalling an error.  This way people will know who to
  contact for the problem.
* w3-epoch.el (w3-insert-graphic): Added support for ALIGN attribute
  of the IMG tag.
* w3-parse.el (w3-fix-paragraphs-in-region): Fixed stupid problem where
  ordered lists would not be filled correctly if unordered lists were
  positioned before them in the buffer.  Thanks to Bengt Andersson
  <Bengt.Andersson@telelogic.se> for noticing the problem.

Wed Oct 20 11:35:40 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-auth.el (w3-basic-auth): Fixed a stupid problem in a regular
  expression that caused it to only do access-authorization lookups on the
  first part of the path.  Now passes all cern tests successfully.  On to
  pubkey!
* w3-mime.el (w3-create-mime-request): Took out all the \r's.  Was
  screwing up Cern's experimental authorization server.
* w3-forms.el: Fixed problem in the handling of TEXT input tags when the
  initial value was longer than the visible size. Also fixed problem where
  typing in a password longer than the visible size caused an error.
* w3-url.el (w3-open-local): Changed this function to call w3-sentinel
  if it was called interactively.  This way 'o' in a w3 buffer still
  works.
* w3-epoch.el (w3-insert-graphic): Completely rewrote this function.
  It should be able to get graphics over any type of protocol (it
  goes thru w3-retrieve).  w3-graphic-converter-alist also now goes by
  MIME types.

Tue Oct 19 10:12:49 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el (w3-use-links): New function to do a completing read on the
  <LINK> tags in the current document.  No keybinding yet.
* w3-misc.el (w3-mail-to-author): New function to send mail to the author
  of a document.  Uses the <LINK> tag with REV=made if any is found.
* w3-parse.el: Added storage of the <LINK> attributes.  w3-mail-to-author
  will send mail to the author if the 'made' LINK is found.
* w3-url.el (w3-fetch): Added in check to see if w3-working-buffer exists
  before calling w3-sentinel.  Would give error "No such buffer  *W3*" if
  you followed a telnet/tn3270/rlogin link.
* w3-gopher.el: Changed the hypertext gopher support to just return raw
  HTML like all the other functions now.
* w3.el (w3-parse-relative-link): Changed w3-relative-link to just call
  w3-fetch on the results of this function so I could use it in
  w3-parse-mime-headers for redirection.
* w3-url.el (w3-retrieve): Moved everything from w3-fetch into this
  function.  It just returns the name of the buffer the raw HTML is put
  into - no processing is done.  w3-fetch is now just a call to this
  function and then w3-sentinel.  HTTP/1.0 redirection and authorization
  are handled before exiting.
* w3-auth.el: Added an optional argument to the w3-XXX-auth functions.  If
  third argument OVERWRITE is non-nil, and a password is found, it is
  ignored and a new user/pass combination are prompted for.

Mon Oct 18 08:38:00 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Moved the call to w3-handle-forms to be
  after w3-restore-pre so that forms inside <PRE> segments would turn out
  right.  Not part of the spec, but useful.  Thanks to Rob Tillotson
  <cq@staff.cc.purdue.edu> for noticing the problem and suggesting the
  fix.
* w3-auth.el (w3-b64-encoding): Actually wrote the base 64 encoding
  function in lisp.  Much faster than using the subprocess.
* w3-lucid.el (x-popup-menu): Added this function to do a blocking popup
  menu.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski (jwz@lucid.com) for telling me where to
  look - its a hacked up version of yes-or-no-p-dialog-box from
  prim/menubar.el.
* w3-mime.el (w3-create-mime-request): Added in checking for authorization
  into the MIME request.  If a match is found using w3-basic-auth, then a
  new line is added with the encoded password.
* w3-auth.el (w3-basic-auth): This now takes an optional parameter PROMPT,
  that if non-nil and a server and/or directory is not found in the list,
  then the user is prompted for a username/password.  If nil, it just
  returns nil if not user/pass found.
* w3-auth.el (w3-encode-password): Due to some problems with numbers
  getting too large when doing base64 encoding, have reworked this
  function to call a program in a subprocess.  Program is specified by the
  variable w3-b64-encoder, and defaults to b64encode, from
  ftp://cs.utk.edu/pub/MIME/b64encode.c.

Sun Oct 17 10:21:06 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-auth.el (w3-encode-password): I think this does base64 encoding
  correctly now.  Have to test it more though.
* w3-auth.el: Started work on 'Basic' authentication.  Not working yet,
  but storage of servers/usernames/passwords/paths works.  Subdirectories
  of 'protected' directories will find the username/password for the
  parent directory, as per the specification (/foo/bar/baz.html will
  locate the password entered before for /foo/test.html or / if any were
  entered).
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mime-headers): Added error checking into the server
  redirection to see if something points to itself.
* w3-typecheck.el (w3-floatp): Fixed regular expression problem where
  floating point numbers would not be parsed correctly.
* w3-typecheck.el (w3-urlp): Wrote this function to do basic typechecking
  of URLS that are input into a <FORM>.
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mime-headers): Added support for server-side
  redirection (301, 302) and the Method: header also (303).
* w3-forms.el (w3-set-radio-button): First pass at doing Radio buttons the
  correct way.  Works (to a point) - it doesn't delete one of the zones
  after changing their values though.  Not sure why.

Sat Oct 16 14:55:39 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: Added support for PASSWORD input tag.  Will use
  ange-ftp-read-passwd and display '*****' as the value.
* w3-forms.el: Added support for OPTIONS INPUT tag.  If in Xwindows and
  able to use x-popup-menu it will pop up a menu.  If not in Xwindows,
  will use a completing read of the possible options.

Fri Oct 15 16:15:59 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-nuke-unsupported): Changed this so that it will support
  the ALT tag in IMG statements.
* w3-gopher.el: Changed the gopher handling so that it will pass
  everything but directories off to the main viewer-handling procedures.

Thu Oct 14 18:26:55 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el (w3-save-url): Fixed problem in w3-save-url where the text was
  saved in the kill-ring, but the kill-ring-yank-pointer was not updated.
  Thanks to Bengt Andersson <Bengt.Andersson@telelogic.se> for noticing
  it.
* w3.el (w3-quit): Fixed a problem where quitting from links would take
  you back one level of buffers too far.  Thanks to Bill Benedetto
  <benedett@gentire.com> for noticing it.

Wed Oct 13 07:10:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el (w3-quit): Added the variable w3-keep-old-buffers.  If t, old w3
  buffers are kept.  If nil, w3 buffers are deleted after you follow a
  link from them.  Need to work on getting the parent of a w3 buffer now
  though.
* w3-lucid.el (w3-extent-at): Fixed problem where Lucid would not realize
  that you were on a link if it was at the first character.
* w3-url.el (w3-build-continuation): Fixed problem where a file with no
  MIME viewer would die - just a misplaced set of parentheses.
* w3-parse.el (w3-check-index): Changed this function so it only inserts
  the <FORM> tags if protocol is HTTP.

Mon Oct 11 07:19:59 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Ordered lists will now have their
  numbers aligned correctly.
* w3-misc.el (w3-fix-fake-urls): This function will turn 'fake' urls like
  ftp://somesite/some/file/ into real links like <A
  HREF="ftp://somesite/some/file/"> - the text of the link is the text it
  replaces.  Will be useful for mail/news reading hooks.

Sat Oct  9 08:14:45 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el (w3-quit): fixed a problem where quitting from a 'previewed'
  buffer would signal an error.
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Fixed this so that <PLAINTEXT> can
  appear anywhere in a buffer, and will be treated appropriately.  Thanks
  to Darrell Kindred (Darrell.Kindred@CMU.EDU) for noticing the problem.

Fri Oct  8 08:51:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Changed all the (set buffer " *W3*") to now use the variable
  w3-work-buffer instead - this will allow me to have multiple receives
  going at the same time.  Also allow me to parse out different buffers
  for urls and not have to copy back and forth to " *W3*". Not fully
  implemented yet.

Tue Oct  5 11:56:30 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el (w3-in-assoc): Changed this funcion so that it returns the
  first match.  Was messing up on some of the wildcards in the default
  MIME viewers.
* w3-viewers.el: Several bugfixese/enhancements to the MIME viewer
  handling.  Everything (including printing, sourcing, and presentation of
  hypertext) is now handled by the MIME viewers.
* w3.el: Will now load the file "~/.w3" if it exists.  Will let you store
  all your w3 variables in the same place.  Only loaded after all the
  different modules.
* w3-viewers.el, w3-url.el: Changed the viewer handling to be by MIME
  content-types all the time.  A new variable, w3-mime-extensions,
  controls how file extensions are mapped onto MIME content-types.
  Inspired by the way MacMosaic handles its viewers.  Should be easier to
  maintain just one viewer list.

Mon Oct  4 06:19:10 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-viewers.el: Changed the viewing to ask if you wish to view the output
  of the process.  Generates unique buffer names, etc.  Thanks to T.V.
  Raman <raman@cs.cornell.edu> for suggesting it.
* w3-viewers.el: Moved all the external/internal viewer handling into this
  file.
* w3.el (w3-quit): Fixed problem where w3 would signal an error when you
  quit and the buffer that preceded it has been killed.  Just goes to the
  next buffer now.  Thanks to Bengt Andersson
  <Bengt.Andersson@telelogic.se> for noticing it.
* w3-lucid.el: Applied patch from Darrell Kindred
  <Darrell_Kindred@cmu.edu> which fixed a problem with finding tags of
  hyperlinks when it had other attributes (<ADDRESS>,<B>, etc) as well.

Fri Oct  1 06:29:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-fix-paragraphs-in-region):  Added support for the <HR>
  tag (horizontal rule).
* w3-mime.el (w3-mime-viewer): Fixed a problem where this returned a cons
  where it should have returned a string.  Thanks to Bengt Andersson
  <Bengt.Andersson@telelogic.se> for noticing it (yet again).

* w3-gopher.el: Fixed a few problems with searching
* w3-url.el: removed newlines from regexps - were messing up <PRE>
  segments.
* w3-url.el: changed mailto to include the url that it was sent from.

Mon Sep 27 13:57:34 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-typecheck.el (w3-intp): Changed the function to check whether an
  integer was valid.  Would mess up in emacs19, where 12.5 is a good
  parameter to string-to-int.

Sat Sep 25 06:48:55 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-typecheck.el: Added this file to control typechecking of forms entry
  fields.  Checks dates, ints, floats, urls, and text.
* w3-forms.el (w3-do-form-entry): changed so that it will use the new
  typechecking functions.

Fri Sep 24 14:01:54 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lucid.el: completely rewrote the forward and backward link movement.
  Works a lot better now.

Thu Sep 23 11:36:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): fixed <TITLE> handling so it takes out
  leading and trailing spaces/tabs.  Could make it difficult to find a
  buffer when the name began with a space.
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Fixed problem where link names would
  be too long (would include part of the HREF) when the HREF was not
  quoted.  Thanks to Dong-Ping Deng (deng@owl.rhic.bnl.gov) for noticing
  it.

Wed Sep 22 10:49:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el (w3-maybe-relative): Fixed stupid bug where I didn't add the
  new tn3270 link type to a few regular expressions.

Tue Sep 21 10:51:09 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Added support for tn3270://... links.  Thanks to T V Raman
  <raman@cs.cornell.edu> for noticing its lack.
* w3-parse.el (w3-check-index): Added variable w3-use-forms-index.  If
  non-nil, will replace <ISINDEX> tags with a very short <FORM> for
  searching.  Default is t, like Xmosaic.
* w3-vars.el: Added more styles for the <EM> tag.

Mon Sep 20 07:02:28 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el (w3-find-specific-link): Emacs19 can now find #identifier
  marks in documents.
* w3-gopher.el (w3-gopher-retrieve): Fixed a problem with gopher sending
  more than one character 'description' to the server.  Would result in
  'Can't open 1/whatever' in some cases.
* w3-misc.el (w3-show-hotlist): Added this function to show the hotlist in
  a hypertext form.  Thanks to Stephen Simpson (simpson@math.psu.edu) for
  suggesting it.
* w3-forms.el: Added in support for emacs 18
* w3-emacs.el: Added in support for deleting an arbitrary zone.  This
  was needed to make forms support work correctly.
* w3-vars.el (w3-be-asynchronous): added this variable to control whether
  documents would be retrieved in a non-blocking way over HTTP.

Sun Sep 19 14:15:39 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-handle-em-tags): Fixed problem where emacs18 would
  die on handling any <EM> tag.  Thanks to mcr@ccs.carleton.ca
  (Michael Richardson) for pointing it out.
* w3-mime.el (w3-mime-viewer): Fixed problem with the viewer finder - was
  trying to do a car of a string Keith Waclena
  <keith@neuromancer.lib.uchicago.edu> for sending me the fix.

Fri Sep 17 09:23:08 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el: fixed problem where deleting or adding hotlist entries
  would not update the menubar.  Thanks to jsc@mit.edu for noticing the
  problem.

Mon Sep 13 06:40:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added the <REMOVED> and <ADDED> tags (both as containers and roles of
  the <EM> tag.
* w3-parse.el: took out the conversion of IMG tags to hyperlinks - was
  messing up when links were nested - need to work on it.
* w3-lists.el (w3-build-table): tables should now handle <DD> with no
  matching <DT> a little better.  Don't know why people bother writing
  HTML this bad, but oh well.
* w3-mime.el (w3-parse-mime-headers): Had a problem parsing out the mime
  headers if there wasn't a crlf at each endline, which broke parsing
  NCSA's new 1.0 server.  Fixed now.

Fri Sep 10 05:52:06 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: took out blank definition of w3-submit-form that
  would screw up submitting forms.  (Emacs19.el got loaded after
  w3-forms.el so would have a blank definition)

Thu Sep  9 07:57:58 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el: Added support for <SP> (nonbreaking spaces), and <BR>
  (force line breaks), and <EM> tags - the EM tags don't allow multiple
  tags right now (ala <EM B I> </EM>, but nesting of <EM> tags works.)

Wed Sep  8 11:58:21 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-build-continuation): the fetching of grouop annotations
  has been removed, as the experiment at NCSA has ended.
* w3-forms.el (w3-revert-form): finished this function - now works
  correctly. 
* Added code to all emacs-specific files to call w3-do-form-entry if
  w3-follow-link is called on a zone that is tagged with 'w3form.
* I have serious doubts whether the form support will work in emacs18 - I
  need to write a delete-zone function for it, but that might be a bear.
  Will toy with it later.

Tue Sep  7 07:13:36 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: added a (delete-overlay zone) if running FSF19 so that not
  all edits are sent when you submit a form.
* w3-forms.el: now, if a checkbox's VALUE/DEFAULT field is empty, it is
  sent as name=PRIMED, ala xmosaic.
* w3-forms.el: fixed bug where the maxlength would be set to 20 instead of
  unlimited if it was not specified.  (Actually, its set to 10,000 but I
  think that should be enough for a while. :)

Mon Sep  6 08:59:43 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: Eureka!  They actually work now.  Successfully submits to
  the NCSA server/demo pages.  Still a little kludgey, but cleaning it up
  should be too difficult.
* w3-forms.el: forms now keyed by number so it will be easier to submit
  them back to the server.  Also changed the submit and reset buttons to
  take their button labels from the VALUE tag as xmosaic does.

Sun Sep  5 09:17:42 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-forms.el: more work on forms support - can now click on check boxes
  and enter text in the entry areas.
* w3-forms.el: added support for the parsing of forms

Sat Sep  4 11:06:12 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mime.el: Fixed a problem where mime viewers would not work correctly
  - tried to do a car() on a string.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-add-document-to-hotlist): fixed a bug in the creation
  of gopher hotlist entries.  Thanks to Erik Ostrom
  (eostrom@mcs-server.gac.edu) for noticing and patching it.
* w3-gopher.el: more work on trying to get searching to work - almost
  there. 

Wed Sep  1 09:17:00 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-gopher.el: Did quite a bit of work on the gopher support.  Lots of
  ideas, some code from the original gopher.el, but this keeps it in
  hypertext - can print, get the document source, add to hotlist, etc.
  Searching still does not work.

Tue Aug 31 10:03:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el: Changed the viewer handling so that it creates unique
  filenames - if you viewed several things at once, it would write over
  the old file, and kill the old viewers.  Also fixed problem where it
  wouldn't delete the w3-tmp file when it was done viewing.

Mon Aug 30 10:19:07 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-gopher): added variable w3-use-hypertext-gopher.  If 't'
  use the gopher interface I just wrote, or use Scott Snyder's gopher
  mode.  (The gopher mode is a slightly more complete, but mine preserves
  the hypertext feel)
* w3-gopher.el: added this file - rolled my own gopher interface this
  afternoon.  Needs more work, but seems functional.
* w3-misc.el: changed the viewer handling so that it handles the viewers
  asynchronously again.

Fri Aug 27 07:06:39 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-handle-address): address handling handles newlines
  before and after ADDRESS tags better - so multiple ADDRESS tags
  following each other don't have more than one newline, etc.

Thu Aug 26 14:49:28 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-fix-paragraphs-in-region): fixed problem where the
  fleading spaces/tabs of a line in a PRE or XMP segment would get
  nuked.  Thanks to Bob Olson (olson@mcs.anl.gov) for noticing it.

Tue Aug 24 22:49:38 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-epoch.el: fixed a typo - left out a " in a defvar which caused the
  compiles to fail.  Thanks to Andrew Violette (violett@indiana.edu) for
  noticing it. 

Mon Aug 23 07:12:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el (w3-lookup-style): Fixed stupid mistake where emacs19
  wouldn't return any styles from this function
* w3-parse.el: Fixed a problem where it would not fill paragraphs
  correctly after the last PRE segment of the text.
* w3-parse.el: Made the parser a lot less destructive (not as many
  delete-regions) - this should make it handle overlapping formatting
  better in most cases.  And maybe a little faster, since it doesn't have
  to create as many strings and do as many re-insertions.

Sun Aug 22 09:25:14 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: rewrote w3-view-this-url and w3-follow-link so that they
  won't sometimes choke on links at the end of bold/italic/whatever zones.
* w3-url.el (w3-http): now prints outi ts reading status (Reading.....)
* w3-lucid.el: Took out the copying of a non-existent 'underline face. 

Wed Aug 18 06:27:12 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-write-global-history): fixed this so it actually works
  again - forgot to change it when I changed the format of w3-history-list
  to be an assoc list.

Tue Aug 17 18:01:00 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-fetch-annotations): Fixe problem where the annotation
  fetch would die if the server couldn't be contacted.

Mon Aug 16 17:04:23 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: took out the xresource reading - will depend on
  emacs*w3-XXX-style.AttributeFont like the lucid emacs stuff.
* w3-lucid.el, w3-emacs19.el: changed these so that if the newly created
  faces aren't set up in the xdefaults, it will copy the appropriate face
  (header-style copies 'bold-italic, etc).  Thanks Michael J. Lamoureux
  (tolamour@engin.umich.edu)

Sun Aug 15 09:22:52 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: Added #linkname finding for local files and ftp html files.
* w3.latex: added a section on going through firewalls/telnet, and using
  the new tcp.c and tcp.el package.
* w3.el: Changed the w3-help function to make sure a function is defined
  before checking for documentation strings, etc.  Also changed it so that
  it puts it in a hypertext buffer.  This opens up the idea of putting
  links in the documentation strings. :)
* Made tcp.c and tcp.el part of the 'extras' distribution.
* w3-mosaic.el: Fixed problem where it would try to send the annotation
  request to a string if w3-open-stream failed.
* w3-misc.el: changed the telnet handling so that it will return 'nil' if
  telnet could not connect to the remote host.
* w3-vars.el (w3-color-display): this will now be set correctly in emacs19
  - had spelled a function name wrong.
* w3-url.el: Change w3-open-local and w3-file to respect new variable
  w3-directory-format, which tells it whether to have a hypertext
  directory listing, or just pass off to dired.

Fri Aug 13 07:50:50 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el: Fixed problem with not killing the "Process *anno*
  finished" in http bufffers.
* w3-lists.el: Fixed bug where w3-sublists-exist would bomb in epoch.
  Epoch's re-search-forward returns t or nil, not the point of the
  match like lucid/emac18/emacs19.  Several people pointed it out.

Thu Aug 12 17:51:09 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el (w3-pass-to-viewer): Fixed problem where this would not
  display a picture if you were in Xwindows - flaw in a logical statement.
  Thanks to Phil Kime (philkime@cogsci.edinburgh.ac.uk) for noticing it.
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Added a few patches from Erik Ostrom
  (fiicmds04.tu-graz.ac.at) - fixes bug with only recognizing NAMEd hrefs
  when the NAMEs are quoted, and botching of relative #links.
* w3-url.el: changed w3-http and w3-gopher to check the port # - if it is
  in w3-bad-port-list, ask for confirmation before opening the connection.

Tue Aug 10 13:07:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* New variable w3-bad-server-list, that is a list of HTTP/0.9 servers that
  can barf on HTTP/1.0 requests.  Generally just servers that have a
  decent amount of lag from your site (or that completely barf on
  HTTP/1.0, like the TeXinfo gateway at ohio-state).
* w3-mime.el: changed w3-create-mime-request to check w3-bad-server-list
  for the current server and the value of w3-use-http2.  If both are
  false, then generate an HTTP/1.0 request, otherwise HTTP/0.9
* w3-url.el: changed w3-http to always use w3-create-mime-request.

Mon Aug  9 08:52:10 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Added w3-documents-menu, an assoc list of titls and urls to turn
  into a menu if you are in lemacs or emacs19.  Add support for running it
  on dumb terminals via completing-read later.
* w3.el: Ripped out all the variable definitions into w3-vars.el
* w3-mime.el: fixed quite a few problems with w3-create-mime-request
* w3-misc.el: think I finally got the truncated pages problem fixed.
  (yeah, right :)
* w3.el: Added code from Erik Ostrom (eostrom@fiicmds04.tu-graz.ac.at) to
  patch gopher-mode to throw you back into w3 when encountering a WWW link
  in gopher.  Hopefully these will make it back into the main gopher.el.
* w3-emacs19.el (w3-back-link): Added fix from Erik Ostrom
  (eostrom@fiicmds04.tu-graz.ac.at) so it won't give you an error in files
  with only 1 link when you try to move backward.
* w3-epoch.el: fixed a typo where you wouldn't be able to retrieve
  images over http.

Sun Aug  8 13:56:11 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: added support for file://localhost urls.  Thanks to
  witbrock@cmu.edu for pointing out that they didn't work
* w3-emacs.el: took out the searching forward for '[' in the
  goto-start-of-zone routine.  Would fail if w3-delimit-links was nil.
  Thanks to witbrock@cmu.edu for pointing it out.
* Revamped w3-url.el, w3-mosaic.el, and w3-misc.el to get the telnet
  support working better.  No more mucking around with filters, etc.
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Changed the link routine so that it
  will default to putting the end of a link at the end of the current line
  if none is found normally.
* w3-url.el: Local directories are now put into a hypertext buffer, and
  parsed by w3.  Not sure if I should leave it this way or not.

Sat Aug  7 03:28:58 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lists.el (w3-build-table): Changed it so you don't need to have a
  DT in a DL list.
* w3-mime.el (w3-mime-viewer): fixed this function to actually work! :)
  (Was returning a list of the viewer, had to add a (car).)
* Applied several patches from Jin S Choi (jsc@monolith.mit.edu), fixing
  several stupid mistakes I had made. :)  Including, too many ')' in
  emacs19, bad font setting in emacs19, noticed truncated pages via http2,
  underlining of headings is off by default now.
* w3-url.el: no longer print out "Reading..." when receiving documents -
  would sometimes scramble the document.
* w3-misc.el: w3-open-stream no longer errors when it can't connect to a
  server - this would cause w3 to bomb if the annotation server were down.
  Thanks to Jin S Choi (jsc@monolith.mit.edu) for noticing it.
* w3-misc.el: w3-send-string should be a little better about not sending
  mulitple lines to the server now, especially in emacs19 & epoch(?) where
  accept-process-output accepts a timeout.

Fri Aug  6 14:45:20 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el: changed the gopher handling to pass off everything to gopher
  mode, so it can now handle gifs, images, etc.
* w3-lists.el: Made DL be compact by default until I get the code to
  change it based on DL COMPACT working right.
* w3.el: removed the w3-useful-documents function - not really worth
  having.
* w3-lists.el: Totally rewrote the main loop so its not recursive, and
  doesn't use save-restriction.  Much faster now.  Also truly fixed
  problem with not nesting correctly.
* w3-html+.el: a few tweaks, not ready for prime time yet though. 

Thu Aug  5 08:22:16 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el: Fixed bug in w3-fix-paragraphs that would cause it to loop
  indefinitely if there were more than 2 PRE sections in a document.
* w3-misc.el: Will now print out "Reading....." when receiving input.
* w3-misc.el: w3-open-stream will now try to open the stream
  w3-connection-retries times until it receives a valid connection.

Wed Aug  4 08:49:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-html+.el: can now include links as data table elements.  Don't wrap
  stuff onto next lines yet though.

Tue Aug  3 00:39:50 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lists.el: nested lists don't indent too far now.  Normal lists are
  only indented 1 tab.
* w3-html+.el: started work on this file to contain experimental HTML+
  parsing routines.  Will probably eventually rewrite most of the parser.
  Mostly support for tables in right now.  Will release soon.

Mon Aug  2 09:21:23 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el: Added support for arbitrary tags (!ENTITY ...), and
  support for endash and emdash entities.
* w3-parse.el: Fixed problem where links with no HREF field would bomb out
  the parser (trying to string-match on nil).

Thu Jul 29 10:35:06 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-lists.el: found major bug with nesting multiple ULs inside of an
  OL  Seems to be fixed now though.

Wed Jul 28 08:29:31 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.latex: revamped this so I can now use the latex2html perl script by N
  F Drakos (nikos@cbl.leeds.ac.uk).  This will (almost) guarantee that the
  online documentation is as up-to-date as the latex files.
* w3-parse.el: Will now be able to find titles that don't have TITLE and
  /TITLE on the same line.
* w3-parse.el: Now stores the full url in each link's data zone - this
  will allow print-url-under-point to work, and will make it easier to
  write something that prints out a string of html documents.
* w3-lists.el: Added this file.  Contains new functions to do better
  nesting of lists.  Shouldn't hang emacs, but if it does, let me know
  right away and I'll try to fix it.  Works great on the NCSA demo
  document - and it has DLs inside ULs inside DLs inside ULs, so I figured
  it was a good torture test for it. :)
* w3-mosaic.el: changed the hotlist parsing code to remove empty lines so
  you won't get a document type of ^Jhttp: if there are spurious blank
  lines in the hotlist file.

Mon Jul 26 09:45:34 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: Fixed forward and backward link movement.
* w3-parse.el: Now transforms IMG ... tags into HREFs.

Sun Jul 25 15:00:43 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-misc.el: added function w3-find-this-file, which will do a find file
  on the current w3 documents source (if in FTP or local file mode).  Will
  be able to do it over HTTP when HTTP/1.0 becomes supported.  Thanks to
  Heiko Muenkel (muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de) for suggesting it.
* w3-misc.el (w3-send-string): Added a sit-for statement so it will wait
  for process output - if the process is closed, then don't send any more
  lines of the request.  This seems to have stopped the truncation of
  pages.

Fri Jul 23 07:23:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Added patches by mhpower@athena.mit.edu.  Fixed a problem with a
  non-existent gopher directory in w3-interesting-docs, and a typo.
* w3-url.el (w3-unhex): Added patches by mhpower@athena.mit.edu.  This
  should give the correct values now.  Was off by 6.

Thu Jul 22 12:05:17 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu) 
* w3.el: Added new variable w3-use-http2.  If 't', w3 will use the
  HTTP/1.0 support that for some reason truncates pages.  Default is t
* Makefile: fixed stupid mistake where I left out a ${LISPDIR} so it
  always tried to install in the root directory (/)

Tue Jul 20 11:52:33 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-fix-paragraphs): This function now respects PRE and XMP
  segments and won't fill paragraphs in them.

Mon Jul 19 09:22:17 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Fixed a problem where the text from
  the last link would be used if there was a newline before the closing
  /A in a link.  Also fixed several places where a link listing would
  inherit items from the last link if they weren't defined (METHOD, URN,
  etc)

Sat Jul 17 11:36:31 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Started work on adding NeXT mouse support in w3-emacs.el
* Disabled the HTTP/1.0 support - was truncating pages for some reason.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-grok-annotation-format): Won't bomb if one of the
  PAN-###.html files doesn't exist.

Fri Jul 16 07:32:54 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-do-personal-annotation): this will now correctly create
  the LOG file in the personal annotation directory if it doesn't exist.
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Wrapped all the parsing stuff in a 
  (let ((case-fold-search t)) ,,,) so that lowercase tags will be
  recognized correctly.  Thanks to rhb@hotsand.att.com for noticing it
  still messed up on lowercase tags.

Thu Jul 15 11:11:34 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-docomp.el (compile-w3): Added w3-mime.el to the list of files to
  compile. 
* w3.el: Added lines to make w3-current-mime-* buffer local 
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Added variable w3-right-border to
  control indentation on the right hand side of the buffer.  (Thanks to
  Nathan Torkington (Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz) for suggesting it.
* w3-misc.el (w3-basepath): This will no longer bomb if you are in a
  scratch buffer (Thanks to Nathan Torkington
  (Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz) for reporting it.
* Release Version .9b
* w3.el (w3-viewer-alist): The command to execute should now include a
  '%s' wherever you want a filename to appear.  
* Should now send all the right headers to a server, and act correctly.
  (Won't bomb if server doesn't send make a MIME-ified document)
* w3-mime.el: Can now create a valid HTRQ, parse a document's response
  headers, and figure out if a document is a MIME-ified response.
* w3-mime.el: First crack at making w3 mime compliant.

Wed Jul 14 03:42:08 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el (w3-useful-documents): Added an 'interesting-docs' assoc list.
  Similar to Xmosaics 'Documents' menu - just interesting interfaces that
  are in the web.
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Took the file viewing code out of this
  function - should never be evaluated.
* w3.el (w3-viewer-assoc-list): No longer automatically append
  auto-mode-alist to this - will mess up finding of hypertext files if you
  have html-mode in your list.
* w3-url.el: several changes to this file to actually make the external
  viewers actually work again.

Tue Jul 13 12:36:34 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-telnet): Changed this to use terminal-emulator instead of
  transparent-window, since it won't work in emacs19 or lucid.
* w3-url.el (w3-file): Will now correctly remember the name of the last
  buffer when retrieving files via ftp.  Thanks to Dong-Ping Deng
  (deng@bunny.rhic.bnl.gov) for noticing it didn't.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-parse-personal-annotations): no longer bombs if the
  annotation directory doesn't exist.  Thanks to Heiko Muenkel
  (muenkel@tnt.uni-hannover.de) for noticing.
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-table): Building of definitions list is forgiving
  if there is no DD.

Mon Jul 12 07:08:38 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: changed add-hook to use w3-member.  Thanks to Larry Masinter
  (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for suggesting it.
* w3-parse.el & w3.el: fixed the run-hooks calls so they will actually
  work.  Thanks to Larry Masinter (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for pointing
  out my mistake.
* Makefile: fixed a few problems - thanks to eostrom@iicm.tu-graz.ac.at
  for pointing them out. (Things like not compiling hyperbole, can now
  configure what file to update the autloads and stuff in.)
* w3-parse.el (w3-balance-XXX): fixed stupid mistake where I didn't remove
  calls to string-to-int after redefining another function.
* w3-misc.el (w3-count-occurences): added this function so "XX matches"
  does not flash in the minibuffer when balancing PRE and XMP segments.
  Directly from the emacs19 how-many function, but with no message at the
  end.
* w3-url.el (w3-mailto): changed syntax of mailto support to be
  mailto:any-address-compliant-with-rfc822.  It just pops up a mail buffer
  and sticks the rest of the url after mailto: in the To: line.  mailto
  also now honors the variable w3-mutable-windows.
* w3-parse.el (w3-balance-xmp): added this function to balance XMP
  segments just like PRE segments.

Sun Jul 11 08:08:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-print.el (w3-convert-latex-to-html): added this function to convert
  LaTeX documents to HTML.  Not sure why - was just bored. :)
* w3-url.el (w3-mailto): added this function to support a new link type.
  mailto://host/user will create a mail buffer and mail to user@host.  The
  syntax for this may change since it is not standard.
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-table): fixed problem for when there was no
  corresponding DD for a DT in a definition list.  A few documents at
  CERN are like this.

Sat Jul 10 08:55:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.latex: did lots of work updating the documentation.
* w3-emacs19.el (w3-emacs19-setup-faces): made function w3-try-make-XXX so
  that w3 will still load and run, even if you use a font like '6x13' that
  it can't make bold or italic.
* w3-parse.el: PRE and ADDRESS tags now look a little better.
* w3-mosaic.el: changed the annotation functions to set the
  w3-current-annotation _AFTER_ calling html-mode, which will nuke all
  buffer-local variables.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-add-personal-annotation): Now supports adding personal
  annotations.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-add-group-annotation): now inserts /PRE as the first
  line so that you can use all the formatting characteristics of HTML.
  
Fri Jul  9 07:31:20 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-delete-personal-annotation): delete the current
  annotation from your personal directory.
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-fetch-personal-annotations): fixed dumb mistake in
  formatting the url of each annotation.
* w3-parse.el (w3-prepare-buffer): Will now check for any personal
  annotations and put them at the end of the buffer (after group
  annotations, if any).
* w3-mosaic.el: added functions for reading the personal annotations from
  w3-personal-annotation-directory.  No support for addition or deletion
  of personal annotations yet.
* w3.el (w3-mode.el): Delete group annotation option is only available in
  lucid when user is in an annotation.
* w3-[lucid|emacs19].el: changed menus to include deleting and adding
  group|personal annotations
* w3-mosaic.el: started working on adding personal annotation support.

Thu Jul  8 15:32:45 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el (w3-add-group-annotation): changed this so that it will
  load up html-mode and have C-c C-c send the annotation.
* w3-mosaic.el: Annotations are now fetched if w3-group-annotation-server
  is defined.
* w3-mosaic.el: Annotations can now be deleted - no key binding yet.
* w3-mosaic.el: Annotations can now be added.  No key binding yet
  
Wed Jul  7 13:16:21 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el (w3-back-link): Fixed w3-back-link so that the cursor will
  be at the beginning of the link.
* w3-emacs19.el: changed all the functions to use native emacs19 overlay
  functions, instead of hacked up lucid-like syntax.  (Menus are still
  done in lucid-style though)

Tue Jul  6 12:41:03 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-mosaic.el: Started work on w3-add-annotation and w3-fetch-annotations
  to implement the NCSA group annotation facilities.  Don't work right now
  - not sure why.  Need good docs (which don't exist) for the server. :)
* w3.el (w3-view-url): Fixed problem where this function would put too
  many '/' in the url.
* w3-emacs19.el: Made a few changes to forward and backward movement among
  links.  Still a few bugs, but can now find links in headers.

Mon Jun 28 12:46:09 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added the variables w3-link-start-delimiter and
  w3-link-end-delimiter so you don't have to edit the code to surround
  links with something other than '[[' and ']]'.  Thanks to Andrew
  Violett (violett@indiana.edu) for suggesting this.

Sun Jun 27 14:54:50 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-parse.el (w3-balance-pre): added this function to insert missing
  /PRE tags.  Several documents on info.cern.ch leave these out and
  cause the browser to crash (args out of range -5,1 or some such).
* w3.el (w3-quit): Fixed bug if running in emacs19 without X, would cause
  terminal to lock up indefinitely.
* w3.el: w3-view-url now takes optional argument no-show.  If you pass it
  an argument from a lisp function, it will return the current url without
  message'ing it in the minibuffer.
* w3-(lucid|emacs|emacs19|epoch).el: w3-view-this-url now acts the same as
  w3-view url (doesn't flash the url in the minibuffer).
* w3-(lucid|emacs19).el: Added some items to the menu, and a separator
  between the links lists and the normal commands.

Sat Jun 26 11:47:52 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: slight modifications.  Nothing really noticeable.
* w3-print.el (w3-print-this-url): fixed this so ftp files will print
  correctly.  Also had to change w3-file.

Thu Jun 24 09:02:23 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-parse-buffer): Check to see if a url is already in the
  history list before storing.  (Also check for bogus ones like
  file:historylist.
* w3-misc.el (w3-show-history-list): Added this function to show the
  history list to the user in hypertext form.  I just use w3-history list
  and make a hypertext buffer of it on the fly.  Thanks to Matthew Newhook
  (matthew@jeeves.engr.mun.ca) for suggesting it.
* w3-url.el: no longer store the URL in the history list here.  Do it in
  w3-parse-buffer so I can store the TITLE of the document also.

Tue Jun 22 10:18:54 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el (w3-document-source): Fixed stupid problem where I put http in
  twice when building url of current document.  Thanks to Denys Duchier
  (dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca) for noticing/fixing it.

Mon Jun 21 12:38:23 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-url.el (w3-telnet): Will actually work now.  Was bombing when the url
  was not of the form username@hostname:port.  Would try to extract the
  username, even though it wouldn't exist.  Thanks to Phil Molloy
  (Molloyd@ICD.Teradyne.COM) for noticing it.
* w3-parse.el (w3-build-links-list): Fixed a problem where a newline right
  after after the > in a url would cause the text of the link not to show
  up.  Thanks to Dirk Husemann (Dirk.Husemann@Informatik.Uni-Erlangen.De)
  for the code to fix it (slightly modified).
* w3.el (w3-doc-variables): Moved a paren in w3-doc-variables so that
  w3-xterm will be documented.  Thanks to Denys Duchier
  (dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca) for noticing.
* w3-misc.el (w3-uncompress): Changed this so it actually works.  Was
  passing a list instead of the cdr to the shell-command.  Thanks to
  Phil Molloy (Molloyd@ICD.Teradyne.COM) for noticing.

Sun Jun 20 08:14:28 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3.el: Added function to store the current URL in the kill ring.  Thanks
  to Mark Eichin (eichin@cygnus.com) for the idea/code.
* w3.el: Changed w3-help so that it will work under emacs 19.
* w3-emacs19.el: only require lmenu & lucid when in X, otherwise emacs
  compiled without X will die.  Thanks to Erik Ostrom
  (eostrom@fiicmds04.tu-graz.ac.at) for noticing it.
* w3.el: only call w3-build-menu if in emacs19 & in x . . .
* w3.el: Changed searching code so that it replaces all spaces with '+'.
  Was causing some servers to time out if it didn't.  Thanks to Jin S Choi
  (jsc@monolith.mit.edu) for pointing this out.
* w3-parse.el: added a check in w3-fix-paragraphs and
  w3-build-ordered-lists to see if emacs19 is running.  If so, add an
  extra newline, since v19 seems to fill paragraphs differently than the
  other flavors.
* w3-emacs.el: added (defvar w3-default-style nil), so the code that hides
  HREF's with no links won't barf.
* w3-emacs19.el: changed 1 line defuns to defsubst, since function calls
  are expensive.
* w3-emacs19.el: Finding of #linknum should work now . . . no map-extents
  in the lucid emulation package - will probably write one later.
* w3-emacs19.el: Wrapped all the font stuff in an (if (eq window-system 'x)
  so it wouldn't barf if emacs19 was loaded while emacs was on a dumb
  terminal.
* w3.el: added variable w3-running-FSF19, and have it load w3-emacs19.el
  if set to t.  (Determined by emacs-version > 19, and not running lucid)

Sat Jun 19 16:09:28 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-emacs19.el: Changed bindings on the mouse buttons to react to a
  mouse-up event instead of the mouse-down event, because it would try to
  paste into the buffer on the mouse-up.  Bleah. :)
* w3-url.el: Modified the ftp: support so that it will parse out html
  files, and will also be able to follow relative links within ftp'd html
  docs.

Sat Jun 19 10:01:45 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fix stupid bugs in Makefile from where I delete some things when
  it was on my linux box
* Support for some ISO chars by Ulrich Pfeifer 
  (pfeifer@ls6.informatik.uni-dortmund.edu).

* Release v.5b

Thu Jun 17 14:58:32 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Better emacs 19 support from jsc@monolith.MIT.EDU
* URLS that are just for reference (no HREF, but has a title) are no longer
  highlighted, so people won't be tempted to click on them.  Thanks to
  Erik Ostrom (eostrom@fiicmds04.tu-graz.ac.at) for pointing this out.

Fri Jun 11 12:14:47 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

  spaces.  Stupid misplacement of a 't'.
* Added .gz extension for gzip to w3-uncompressor-alist
* Trial run of emacs 19 support for fonts, etc from Jin S Choi
  (jsc@monolith.MIT.EDU).  Not sure everything works yet.

  things like telnet+term from linux.

Thu Jun  3 13:34:48 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed problems with gopher, and unhexing of escaped characters.  Thanks

Fri May  7 08:52:30 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Release .31b
* Fixed major problem with w3-fetch.  Would bomb with stringp = nil if
  done interactively.

Mon May  3 08:16:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Can now print the url under point - no key binding yet.

  to scott snyder (snyder@fnald0.fnal.gov) for patching gopher-mode to
  support this.  No key binding yet.

Fri Apr 30 11:56:57 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed a problem with viewing local files with w3-viewer-alist

Thu Apr 29 11:43:13 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* w3-fetch now defaults to the url of the current document if the
  document you invoke it from is in w3-mode.
* Added ability to find links of just #link - doesn't need to reload
  the whole document.
* Applied several patches fro Alastair Burt (burt@dfki.uni-kl.de)
  * Better updating of menu bar in Lucid
  * Updates the interal w3-hotlist when you delete a hotlist entry

    Something.Thesaurus
* Fixed problems with w3-graphics-converter-alist, and lots of
  problems with the w3-hypertext-extns.
* Fixed problem with finding files for dired-mode - would still try to
  do the viewing, etc.

Wed Apr 28 07:23:56 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed problem with dired-ing remote ftp files.  Removed lots of
  useless if file-directory-p [...], and just did a find-file - let
  ange-ftp and dired take care of it - they know how better.
* Fixed problem where w3-epoch-frob-resources would not set the
  defaults if no Xresources were specified - thanks to Luis Miguel
  Silveira (lms@rle-vlsi.mit.edu) for noticing it.
* Changed the w3-delimit-links variable so that you can specify
  'linkname as its value, and have the old style "Link text
  here[link#here]" style of showing links.  Nil shows nothing,
  non-nil, non-linkname shows [[ & ]] around link text.

Tue Apr 27 15:37:18 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed problem in gopher handling - if no port was specified, it
  would get completely confused.

Mon Apr 26 17:06:33 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.2b
* Fixed problem with putting remote dirs into dired-mode with a bad
  default-filename.  Thanks to Larry Masinter

  groups are supported.

Sun Apr 25 15:36:55 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed recursive make install bug - thanks to Larry Masinter
  (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing it.
* Fixed problem with no default gopher object type.  Thanks to Larry
  Masinter (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing it.
* Fixed problem with no default gopher port.
* Fixed the auto-documenter so that it would insert "M-x funcname"
  if no bindings were found in the keymap. Thanks to Larry Masinter
  (masinter@parc.xerox.com) for noticing it.
* Fixed problem with w3-file not passing to a viewer correctly.

Thu Apr 22 13:22:53 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed the handling of URL#link finding . . . depends on which
  emacs you are using, due to the weirdness of zones, etc, in each.
* Split the files up again.  Figure with >2000 lines, it should be
  done. :)
* No longer need w3-links-list - store all relevant information in the
  data segment of a zone.  Changed every function to use this new
  structure.

Wed Apr 21 08:24:35 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added variables w3-use-html2latex, w3-html2latex-prog, and
  w3-html2latex-args.  If w3-use-html2latex is non-nil, then
  w3-html2latex-prog is called in a subprocess with the flags defined
  by w3-html2latex-args, with the html source as standard input.
  Default is to do my (bad) regular expression matching to convert.

Tue Apr 20 08:51:19 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Can now specify regular expressions as the car of
  w3-viewer-assoc-list 
* fixed problem where epoch would not defvar the styles - just moved
  them out of w3-epoch-frob-resources, and it works.  Weird.
* Fixed several bugs in the w3-convert-html-to-latex function - now
  handles addresses and &amp; correctly.
* Fixed yet another dumb bug in the insertion of PLAINTEXT in
  non-hypertext documents.
* Added w3-member, instead of builtin (or predefined) member, since
  some definitions don't use equal for comparison like they are
  supposed to.

Mon Apr 19 07:48:56 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.1b
* Added LaTeXing of w3 documents, and automatic printing.  Just an
  edit of the sed script to be a lot of replace-regexps, then a shell
  command to latex a temp file and print it out.
* Added w3-goto-last-buffer, which will take you to the last buffer
  you visited before (kind of like gopher-mode).  Changed w3-quit to
  use this also.
* Fixed a bug in w3-reload-document that would make it bomb on local
  file reloads.
* Better nesting of lists.

Sun Apr 18 13:50:38 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added variable w3-mutable-windows - if t, w3 pops up buffers in
  another window.
* Added a default-style for w3 buffers

Wed Apr 14 10:18:01 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

* Added global history, for compatability with xmosaic
* Added deletion of hotlist entries
* Changed w3-viewer-alist to automatically include the auto-mode-alist
* Viewers can now include lisp calls (ie: ("txt" . view-mode)) to put
  in files.

  eostrom@nic.gac.edu for the fixes.
* Finally fixed relative-links - .. & . are removed correctly
* Fixed relative links for graphics also.

Tue Apr 13 08:30:58 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added support for reading Xdefaults within Epoch.
* v.04b
* Fixed graphic support to work over http links (Epoch Only)
* Fixed graphic support so it will figure out if the conversion failed
  or not - warning message if it did.
  
Mon Apr 12 07:35:40 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.03b
* Fixed lemacs support so it doesn't nuke your xdefaults.  Also fixed
  the passing of face-objects, since they are screen-specific, and
  therefore a Bad Thing.  Thanks to Jamie Zawinski (jwz@lucid.com)
* Changed menu code so that it put the link # in there also.  Helpful
  for when the links are unnamed, or named 'here' or 'this'.  Thanks
  to Jamie Zawinski (jwz@lucid.com) for saying the menus were hosed.

Sun Apr 11 16:30:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed graphics support for epoch - would only do 1 image per page.
* Fixed a few typos - thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu

Fri Apr  9 00:18:47 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added graphics support for epoch (doesn't work over http, pretty
  much hardwired for me right now - commented out in the release)
* v.02b
* Several bug fixes (link finding, name fixing, others) - thanks to
  eostrom@nic.gac.edu for the fixes.
* Added eostrom@nic.gac.edu's zone-imitation functions for normal emacs.
  Also wrote corresponding forward&back link code.  I wrote the forward&
  back code for epoch&lemacs.

Thu Apr  8 13:23:27 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed being able to jump forward over non-links in []s. Thanks to
  eostrom@nic.gac.edu
* Fixed telnet handling - thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu for noticing
  it and for a preliminary fix.  Refined his fix.  Problem was that
  telnet wasn't getting enough time to start before I sent it a
  command.
* Fixed a few regular expressions - thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu
* Fixed bug in w3-add-document-hotlist which caused an error if the
  hotlist file didn't already exist.  Thanks to eostrom@nic.gac.edu
  for noticing it.

Wed Apr  7 00:08:53 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Split the files into 4 different files for easier editing.
* Modified Makefile to work with the new file structure.
* Fixed a problem with the links code that cropped up with blank HREFS
* HREFs of the form .....#link will now go to 'link' within the target
  document.
* v.01beta - fourth release
* Can now type #### RETURN to go the the ###th link in the current buffer.
* Fixed a bug in XMP handling
* Fixed bugs in the logical/physical styles in definition lists
* Improved indentation of all lists
* Wrapped (require 'ange-ftp) in a (not noninteractive) so it wouldn't
  screw up the compiles.
* Fixed a few problems in the Makefile
* Revamped the way it looks for links in dumb emacs mode.  (Actually,
  all I did was add a .* to the beginning and a parenthesized part of
  the regexp - real rough. :)
* Added support for physical and logical styles.  Looks great in lucid,
  not so hot in epoch (had to use colors, not actual styles).  Suggestions
  welcome.

Tue Apr  6 21:14:14 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Supports nested definition lists (only 1 deep, and only in ordered lists)
* Now supports nested lists (only 1 deep, and only inside ordered lists)

Mon Apr  5 13:34:00 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.008beta - third release

* Added better handling of definition lists.  (No support for Compact
  ones now though)

Fri Apr  2 10:28:08 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Definition lists now keep their zones/extents so they are highlighted
  correctly. 
* Fixed bug in PRE handling - left out a (goto-char (point-min))

Wed Mar 31 08:51:04 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Did work on resolving ./ & ../ links (only works for one level right
  now.  Will work on getting it recursive later.
* Changed data field in extents/zones to be (w3 . type) so I
  wouldn't grab a wrong item.
* Fixed a bug in title handling.  Left something out of an if
  statement and it would try to delete a region that (probably) didn't
  exist.
* Fixed bug in w3-follow-link (added a ':' to end of regexp).  Would
  cause it to screw up on a url like http.html.  Thanks to Erik Ostrom
  (eostrom@nic.gac.edu)
* Changed requires to autoloads where possible
* Wrapped require of transparent.el so it won't get loaded if in X
* Fixed bug in lemacs mouse links.
* Applied numerous patches from har@cs.cmu.edu & jwz@lucid.com to fix
  compilation problems with lemacs & epoch.

Tue Mar 30 15:05:01 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added mouse support for following links in epoch & lucid emacs
  Store the link # in the data segment of the zone.  If mouse is
  clicked in a zone, extract the data, assoc it with w3-links-list and
  call w3-follow-link with it.  Hacky but works. :)
* Added (provide 'w3) for easier loading, etc.
* Fixed problems with epoch highlihting
* Fixed makefile problem (some files left out)

Sun Mar 28 13:04:12 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

* Few changes to the parser
* Fixed PRE Handling so it parses out urls inside.
* Added handling of &#XXX to insert ascii value of XXX.

Fri Mar 26 11:27:52 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Completed document source command.
* Changed it so it won't barf if you try to fetch the same document twice.
* Added w3-reload-document to reload the current file.

Wed Mar 24 16:37:22 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.003beta - put on ftp archive
* Added support for the xmosaic style of hotlist.  Goto and add are
  supported.

Tue Mar 23 08:46:12 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.002beta - put on ftp archive
* Added menus to the lucid emacs code.  Looks a little weird when
  links are named 'here', but not bad.
* Added to the searching code
* Fixed bug in renumbering system (forgot to increment bogus-num)
* Completely rewrote the parser (yet again).  Finally got the HTML
  specs, so it now handles every item possible (hopefully).
* Added support for small things like DL COMPACT, PLAINTEXT, PRE.
* Added code to delete outdated information (HEADER, BODY, etc)
* Added w3-preview-this-buffer, which feeds the current buffer into
  the w3-preprocessor and spits out a formatted buffer.  I use this
  mainly to see if I can break anything, but might be useful when
  writing real html documents.
* Added code to delete useless (to us) HTML headers (NEXTID, etc)
* Added support for index searching.  Mode line is changed to reflect
  this.  Need to use something more noticeable though.
  
Mon Mar 22 07:43:10 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Broke highlighting in definition lists.  Not sure how to get around
  this and still have the DLs formatted correctly.
* Little tweaks
* Cleaned up ^Ms that appeared sometimes
* Added a default port for http links (http://moose/info instead of

Sun Mar 21 13:44:02 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Forgot to include Menu and DL lists, added them.
* Added support for embedded plain text (XMP directive)
* Added 'cacheing' of old info - just made variables buffer-local, and
  save them before kill-all-local-variables, then restore.  Need to figure
  out some way to kill old buffers (only keep last 5, etc)  
* Fine tuned local file support
* Added ftp support - just a link to ange-ftp
* Fixed unNAMEd links yet again - should work better
* Added support for lucid emacs & epoch (highlight links, headers,etc)
  Borrowed code from html-mode.el by marca@ncsa.uiuc.edu
* "Fixed" unNAME'd links.  Big Kludge. Needs work.

Sat Mar 20 14:10:12 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* v.001beta
* Complete rewrite of the parsing code.  Still not pretty, but much
  faster, better paragraph filling.
