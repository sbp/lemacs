(` FORM)  is a macro that expands to code to construct FORM.
Note that this is very slow in interpreted code, but fast if you compile.
FORM is one or more nested lists, which are `almost quoted':
They are copied recursively, with non-lists used unchanged in the copy.
 (` a b) == (list 'a 'b)  constructs a new list with two elements, `a' and `b'.
 (` a (b c)) == (list 'a (list 'b 'c))  constructs two nested new lists.

However, certain special lists are not copied.  They specify substitution.
Lists that look like (, EXP) are evaluated and the result is substituted.
 (` a (, (+ x 5))) == (list 'a (+ x 5))

Elements of the form (,@ EXP) are evaluated and then all the elements
of the result are substituted.  This result must be a list; it may
be `nil'.

As an example, a simple macro `push' could be written:
   (defmacro push (v l)
        (` (setq (, l) (cons (,@ (list v l))))))
or as
   (defmacro push (v l)
        (` (setq (, l) (cons (, v) (, l)))))

LIMITATIONS: \"dotted lists\" are not allowed in FORM.
The ultimate cdr of each list scanned by ` must be `nil'.
(This does not apply to constants inside expressions to be substituted.)

Substitution elements are not allowed as the cdr
of a cons cell.  For example, (` (A . (, B))) does not work.
Instead, write (` (A (,@ B))).

You cannot construct vectors, only lists.  Vectors are treated as
constants.

BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE
Inclusion of (,ATOM) rather than (, ATOM)
or of (,@ATOM) rather than (,@ ATOM)
will result in errors that will show up very late."]))
