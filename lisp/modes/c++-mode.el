;; Introduction
;; ============
;; Do a "C-h m" in a c++-mode buffer for more information on
;; customizing c++-mode.  To submit bug reports hit "C-c C-b" in a
;; c++-mode buffer.  This runs the command c++-submit-bug-report and
;; automatically sets up the mail buffer with all the necessary
;; information.  If you have other questions contact me at the
;; following address: c++-mode-help@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.  Please don't
;; send bug reports to my personal account, I may not get it for a
;; long time.

;; Notes for Novice Users
;; ======================
;; c++-mode facilitates editing of C++ code by automatically handling
;; the indentation of lines of code in a manner very similar to c-mode
;; as distributed with GNU Emacs.  Refer to the GNU Emacs manual,
;; chapter 21 for more information on "Editing Programs".  In fact,
;; c++-mode (through its companion mode entry point c++-c-mode) can
;; also be used to edit both K&R and ANSI C code!
;;
;; To use c++-mode, add the following to your .emacs file.  This
;; assumes you will use .cc or .C extensions for your C++ source:
;;
;; (autoload 'c++-mode   "c++-mode" "C++ Editing Mode" t)
;; (autoload 'c++-c-mode "c++-mode" "C Editing Mode" t)
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;   (append '(("\\.C$"  . c++-mode)
;;             ("\\.cc$" . c++-mode)
;;             ("\\.c$"  . c++-c-mode)   ; to edit C code
;;             ("\\.h$"  . c++-c-mode)   ; to edit C code
;;            ) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; If you want to use the default c-mode for editing C code, then just
;; omit the lines marked "to edit C code".
;;
;; Finally, you may want to customize certain c++-mode variables.  The
;; best place to do this is in the mode hook variable called
;; c++-mode-hook.  Again, see the Emacs manual, chapter 21 for more
;; information.

;; Important Note about Escapes in Comments, and Performance
;; =========================================================
;; You may notice that certain characters, when typed in comment
;; regions, get escaped with a backslash.  This is a workaround for
;; bugs in Emacs' syntax parsing algorithms.  In brief, syntax parsing
;; in Emacs 18 and derivatives is broken because syntax tables are not
;; rich enough to support more than 1 comment style per mode (as C++
;; requires).  The result is that Emacs will sometimes choke on
;; unbalanced parentheses and single quotes in comments.  Please do a
;; "C-h v c++-untame-characters" for more information.
;;
;; This problem affect both the accuracy and performance of c++-mode
;; because some parsing must be performed in Emacs lisp instead of
;; relying on the C primitives.  In general, I've chosen accuracy over
;; performance, but have worked hard to give moderately acceptable
;; speed in all but the most uncommon situations.  You will most likely
;; notice c++-mode slowing when you're editing a file of preprocessor
;; commands, or inside long functions or class definitions.
;; Optimization is an ongoing concern, but the real solution is to fix
;; Emacs.
;;
;; As of release 19.4, Lucid Emacs is distributed with the fixes in
;; place, and c++-mode will automatically take advantage of them so
;; none of the above applies to you.  Similar patches will be part of
;; FSF GNU Emacs 19.  Some patches for GNU Emacs 18 have been released
;; on the beta site, but they are unsupported.  Email for more
;; information.

;; Beta Testers Mailing List
;; =========================
;; Want to be a c++-mode victim, er, beta-tester?  Send add/drop
;; requests to c++-mode-victims-request@anthem.nlm.nih.gov.
;; Discussions go to c++-mode-victims@anthem.nlm.nih.gov, but bug
;; reports and such should still be sent to c++-mode-help only.
;;
;; Many, many thanks go out to all the folks on the beta test list.
;; Without their patience, testing, insight, and code contribution,
;; c++-mode.el would be a far inferior package.

;; Getting c++-mode.el
;; ===================
;; The latest public release version of this file should always be
;; available for anonymous ftp on the Emacs lisp archive machine.  The
;; path to the file is:
;;
;; archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/modes/c++-mode.el.Z 
;; 
;; For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC's
;; ftpmail'er at the address ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Send the
;; following message in the body of your mail to that address to get
;; c++-mode:
;;
;; reply <a valid net address back to you>
;; connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
;; binary
;; uuencode
;; chdir pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/modes
;; get c++-mode.el.Z
;;
;; or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
;; Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.

  "Major mode for editing C++ code.  2.353
To submit a problem report, enter `\\[c++-submit-bug-report]' from a
c++-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with
version information already added.  You just need to add a description
of the problem and send the message.

1. Very much like editing C code,
2. Expression and list commands understand all C++ brackets,
3. Tab at left margin indents for C++ code,
4. Both C++ and C style block comments are recognized,
5. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only,
6. Hungry delete key and auto newline features are optional.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You may notice that some characters (by default, only
single quote) will get escaped with a backslash when typed in a
comment region.  This is a necessary workaround of a bug present in
GNU Emacs 18 and derivatives.  Enter `\\[describe-variable] c++-untame-characters RET'
for more information.  If you are running a patched Emacs, no
characters will be escaped in comment regions, and many functions will
run much faster.

Key bindings:
\\{c++-mode-map}

These variables control indentation style.  Those with names like
c-<thing> are inherited from c-mode.  Those with names like
c++-<thing> are unique for this mode, or have extended functionality
from their c-mode cousins.

 c-argdecl-indent
    Indentation level of declarations of C function arguments.
 c-brace-imaginary-offset
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 c-brace-offset
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 c-continued-brace-offset
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `c-continued-statement-offset'.
 c-continued-statement-offset
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 c-indent-level
    Indentation of C statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 c-label-offset
    Extra indentation for line that is a label, or case or ``default:''

 c++-C-block-comments-indent-p
    Style of C block comments to support.
 c++-access-specifier-offset
    Extra indentation given to public, protected, and private keyword lines.
 c++-always-arglist-indent-p
    Control indentation of continued arglists.  When non-nil, arglists
    continued on subsequent lines will always indent
    `c++-empty-arglist-indent' spaces, otherwise, they will indent to
    just under previous line's argument indentation.
 c++-auto-hungry-initial-state
    Initial state of auto/hungry feature when a C++ buffer is first visited.
 c++-auto-hungry-toggle
    Enable/disable toggling of auto/hungry features.
 c++-backscan-limit
    Limit in characters for looking back while skipping syntactic
    whitespace.  This variable is only used in an un-patched Emacs to
    help improve performance at the expense of some accuracy.  Patched
    Emacses are both fast and accurate.
 c++-block-close-brace-offset
    Extra indentation give to braces which close a block.
 c++-cleanup-list
    A list of construct ``clean ups'' which c++-mode will perform when
    auto-newline feature is on.  Current legal values are:
    `brace-else-brace', `empty-defun-braces', `defun-close-semi'.
 c++-comment-only-line-offset
    Extra indentation for a line containing only a C or C++ style
    comment.  Can be an integer or list, specifying the various styles
    of comment-only line special indentations.
 c++-continued-member-init-offset
    Extra indentation for continuation lines of member initializations; nil
    means to align with previous initializations rather than with the colon.
 c++-default-macroize-column
    Column to insert backslashes when macroizing a region.
 c++-delete-function
    Function called by `c++-electric-delete' when deleting a single char.
 c++-electric-pound-behavior
    List of behaviors for electric pound insertion.
 c++-empty-arglist-indent
    Extra indentation to apply to a line following an empty argument
    list.  nil means to line it up with the left paren.
 c++-friend-offset
    Offset of C++ friend class declarations relative to member declarations.
 c++-hanging-braces
    Controls open brace hanging behavior when using auto-newline feature.
    nil says no braces hang, t says all open braces hang.  non-nil-or-t
    means top-level open braces don't hang, all others do.
 c++-hanging-member-init-colon
    Defines how colons which introduce member initialization lists are
    formatted.  t means no newlines are inserted either before or after
    the colon.  nil means newlines are inserted both before and after
    the colon.  `before' inserts newlines only before the colon, and
    `after' inserts newlines only after colon.
 c++-member-init-indent
    Indentation level of member initializations in function declarations,
    if they are on a separate line beginning with a colon.
 c++-paren-as-block-close-p
    If non-nil, treat a parenthesis which is the first non-whitespace
    on a line as a paren which closes a block (i.e. treat it similar
    to right curly brace).
 c++-relative-offset-p
    Control the calculation for indentation.  When non-nil (the
    default), indentation is calculated relative to the first
    statement in the block.  When nil, the indentation is calculated
    without regard to how the first statement is indented.  Useful when
    using a `c++-special-indent-hook'.
 c++-special-indent-hook
    Hook for user defined special indentation adjustments.  You can use
    this hook, which gets called after a line is indented by the mode,
    to customize indentations of the line.
 c++-tab-always-indent
    Controls the operation of the TAB key.  t means always just indent
    the current line.  nil means indent the current line only if point
    is at the left margin or in the line's indentation; otherwise
    insert a tab.  If not-nil-or-t, then tab is inserted only within
    literals (comments and strings) and inside preprocessor
    directives, but the line is always reindented.  Default is value
    for `c-tab-always-indent'.
 c++-untame-characters
    When non-nil, inserts backslash escapes before certain untamed
    characters in comment regions.  It is recommended that you keep the
    default setting to workaround a nasty Emacs bug, unless you are
    running a patched Emacs.

Auto-newlining is no longer an all or nothing proposition.  In my
opinion, I don't believe it is possible to implement a perfect
auto-newline algorithm.  Sometimes you want it and sometimes you don't.
So now auto-newline (and its companion feature, hungry-delete-key) can
be toggled on and off on the fly.  Hungry-delete-key is the optional
behavior of the delete key so that, when enabled, hitting the delete
key once consumes all preceding whitespace, unless point is within a
literal (defined as a C or C++ comment, or string).  Inside literals,
and with hungry-delete-key disabled, the delete key just calls the
function in variable `c++-delete-function'.

Selection and toggling of these features is controlled by the
variables `c++-auto-hungry-initial-state' and `c++-auto-hungry-toggle'.
Legal values for both variables are:

  `none' (or nil)      -- no auto-newline or hungry-delete-key.
  `auto-only'          -- function affects only auto-newline feature.
  `hungry-only'        -- function affects only hungry-delete-key feature.
  `auto-hungry' (or t) -- function affects both features.

Thus if `c++-auto-hungry-initial-state' is `hungry-only', then only
hungry-delete-key feature is turned on when the buffer is first
visited.  If `c++-auto-hungry-toggle' is `auto-hungry', and both
auto-newline and hungry-delete-key features are on, then hitting
`\\[c++-toggle-auto-hungry-state]' will toggle both features.  Hitting
`\\[c++-toggle-hungry-state]' will always toggle hungry-delete-key
feature and hitting `\\[c++-toggle-auto-state]' will always toggle
auto-newline feature, regardless of the value of
`c++-auto-hungry-toggle'.

Settings for K&R, BSD, and Stroustrup indentation styles are
  c-indent-level                5    8    4
  c-continued-statement-offset  5    8    4
  c-continued-brace-offset                0

;; incorrectly match some continued strings, but this is after all
;; just a weak heuristic.)  Suggestions for improvement (short of the
;; strong scheme shown above) are welcomed.
