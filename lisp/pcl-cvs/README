This is the readme file for pcl-cvs, release 1.03.1.

Pcl-cvs is a front-end to CVS version 1.3.  It integrates the most
frequently used CVS commands into emacs.

There is some configuration that needs to be done in pcl-cvs.el to get
it to work.  See the instructions in file INSTALL.

Full documentation is in pcl-cvs.texinfo.  Since it requires makeinfo
2.14 a preformatted info file is also included (pcl-cvs.info).

If you have been using pcl-cvs 1.02 (which is distributed with CVS
1.3) you should read through the file NEWS to see what has changed.
