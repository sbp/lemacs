*A character set which controls behavior of commands
\\[picture-set-tab-stops] and \\[picture-tab-search].  It is NOT a
regular expression, any regexp special characters will be quoted.
It defines a set of \"interesting characters\" to look for when setting
(or searching for) tab stops, initially \"!-~\" (all printing characters).
For example, suppose that you are editing a table which is formatted thus:
| foo		| bar + baz | 23  *
| bubbles	| and + etc | 97  *
and that picture-tab-chars is \"|+*\".  Then invoking
\\[picture-set-tab-stops] on either of the previous lines would result
in the following tab stops
		:     :     :     :
Another example - \"A-Za-z0-9\" would produce the tab stops
  :		  :	:     :

Note that if you want the character `-' to be in the set, it must be
included in a range or else appear in a context where it cannot be
taken for indicating a range (e.g. \"-A-Z\" declares the set to be the
letters `A' through `Z' and the character `-').  If you want the
character `\\' in the set it must be preceded by itself: \"\\\\\".
