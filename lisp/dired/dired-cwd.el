;; LISPDIR ENTRY for the Elisp Archive ===============================
;;    LCD Archive Entry:
;;    dired-cwd|Sebastian Kremer|sk@thp.uni-koeln.de
;;    |Fix a command's current working directory in Tree Dired. 
;;    |$Date: 1992/03/01 14:18:01 $|$Revision: 1.2 $|

;; INSTALLATION ======================================================
;; 
;; Put this file into your load-path and the following in your ~/.emacs:
;; 
;;   (autoload 'dired-cwd-make-magic "dired-cwd")
;;
;; You have to load dired-x.el in your dired-load-hook to define
;; function default-directory, or you will not benefit from this
;; package: as long as function default-directory is not defined, the
;; functions wrapped by dired-cwd-make-magic will behave as before.

;; EXAMPLE USAGE ======================================================
;;
;; How to fix M-x compile (and grep) to know about Tree Dired's multiple
;; working directories by putting the following lines into your ~/.emacs:
;; 
;;    (require 'compile)
;;    (dired-cwd-make-magic 'compile1)
;;
;; After that, a compilation or grep started in a subdirectory in a
;; Dired buffer will have that subdirectory as working directory.
;;
;; Note you must require 'compile as function compile1 is redefined.
;; You could use a load hook instead by adding the line
;;
;;     (run-hooks 'compile-load-hook)
;;     
;; at the end of compile.el and setting
;;
;;    (setq compile-load-hook '(lambda () (dired-cwd-make-magic 'compile1)))
;;
;; in your ~/.emacs.
