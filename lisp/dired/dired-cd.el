;;; SUMMARY

;;; This extension to Sebastian Kremer's (sk@thp.Uni-Koeln.DE) Tree-Dired
;;; permits the working directory of the dired shell commands
;;; dired-do-shell-command and dired-do-background-shell-command
;;; to be the files' subdirectory under certain circumstances.
;;; Loading this extension does not change the behavior of dired until
;;; the variables dired-cd-same-subdir and/or dired-cd-on-each are
;;; non-nil.  


;;; FUNCTIONALITY PROVIDED

;;; If dired-cd-same-subdir is non-nil and if all the selected files
;;; (marked, non-zero numeric ARG, etc.) are in the same directory, then
;;; dired-do-shell-command and dired-do-background-shell-command will
;;; cause the shell to perform a cd into that directory before the
;;; commands are executed.  Also, the selected filenames will be provided
;;; to the command without any directory components.

;;; If dired-cd-on-each is non-nil and if the on-each option is specified
;;; (numeric arg of zero), then dired-do-shell-command and
;;; dired-do-background-shell-command will perform a cd into the
;;; directory of each file before the commands on that file are executed.
;;; Also, each filename will be provided to the command without any
;;; directory components.  Note that this on-each behavior occurs
;;; regardless of whether the files are all in the same directory or not.

;;; After the above "cd wrapping" has occured, the existing
;;; dired-shell-stuff-it is used to do file-name substitution and
;;; quoting, so custom versions of this procedure should work, e.g.
;;; dired-trans will transform commands correctly.  However, since
;;; filenames lack any directory components, features that use the
;;; directory components will fail, e.g. the dired-trans [d] transform
;;; specifier will be empty.

;;; New variables (user options):
;;;    dired-cd-same-subdir
;;;    dired-cd-on-each
;;;
;;; Replaces procedures:
;;;    dired-do-shell-command  (new doc and prompt, calls dired-cd-wrap-it)
;;;
;;; Adds procedures:
;;;    dired-cd-wrap-it  (wraps calls to dired-shell-stuff-it with "cd <dir>")
;;;    dired-files-same-directory


;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; Put this file into your load-path and add (load "dired-cd") to
;; your dired-load-hook, e.g.
;;
;; (setq dired-load-hook '(lambda ()
;; 			  ;; possibly more statements here
;;			  (load "dired-cd")))
;;
;; Do (setq dired-cd-same-subdir t) and perhaps (setq dired-cd-on-each t)
;; in your .emacs.  By default, dired-cd doesn't change the behavior of 
;; dired when it is loaded. 
;;
;; If dired-cd-same-subdir is non-nil, then the shell commands cd to
;; the appropriate directory if all the selected files (marked,
;; numeric ARG, etc.) are in that directory; however, on-each behavior
;; is not changed.
;;
;; If dired-cd-on-each is non-nil, then each instance of the command
;; for an on-each shell command runs in the file's directory
;; regardless of whether the files are all in the same directory.


(defvar dired-cd-same-subdir nil
  "*If non-nil, and selected file(s) (by marks, numeric arg, \\[universal-argument]) are in same
subdir, causes dired shell command to run in that subdir.  Filenames provided
to shell commands are stripped of their directory components.  Does not
affect behavior of on-each, for that see variable dired-cd-on-each.")

(defvar dired-cd-on-each nil
  "*If non-nil, on-each causes each dired shell command to run in the 
file's directory.  Filenames provided to shell commands are stripped of 
their directory components.  Also see variable dired-cd-same-subdir.")

;; Redefines dired.el's version.
;; Changes to documentation and prompt, and uses dired-cd-wrap-it.
(defun dired-do-shell-command (&optional arg in-background)
  "Run a shell command on the marked files.
If there is output, it goes to a separate buffer.
The list of marked files is appended to the command string unless asterisks
  `*' indicate the place(s) where the list should go.
If no files are marked or a specific numeric prefix arg is given, uses
  next ARG files.  With a zero argument, run command on each marked file
  separately: `cmd * foo' results in `cmd F1 foo; ...; cmd Fn foo'.
  As always, a raw arg (\\[universal-argument]) means the current file.
The option variables dired-cd-same-subdir and dired-cd-on-each
  permit the command\(s\) to run in the files' directories if appropriate,
  and thus determine where output files are created.  Default is top
  directory.  The prompt mentions the file(s) or the marker, the cd subdir,
  and the on-each flags when they apply.
No automatic redisplay is attempted, as the file names may have
  changed.  Type \\[dired-do-redisplay] to redisplay the marked files."
