;;    |Date: 1991/07/05 13:36:01 |Revision: 1.6 |

;; INSTALLATION ======================================================
;; Put this file into your load-path and add (load "dired-trns") to
;; your dired-load-hook, e.g.
;;
;; (setq dired-load-hook '(lambda ()
;; 			  ;; possibly more statements here
;;			  (load "dired-trns")))

;; Transformers are functions that take a file (a string) as an argument
;; and transform it into some other string (e.g., a filename without an
;; extension).
;;
;; Each transformer is associated with a dispatch character. The associations
;; are stored in a keymap for fast and easy lookup. The dispatch character
;; is used to activate the associated transformer function at a particular
;; position in a shell command issued in dired.
;;
;; Transformers can be used to construct complicated shell commands that
;; operate on a large number of files, for example, they allow to create
;; functionality such as "mv *.lsp *.lisp" where each .lsp file is
;; renamed into a a file with same name but new extension .lisp.
