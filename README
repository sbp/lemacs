This directory holds version 19 of Lucid GNU Emacs.
The specific version is in the file lisp/version.el.

See etc/NEWS for release notes, etc.

 The subdirectory `src' holds the C code,
 `lwlib' contains a multi-toolkit library for menus and dialog boxes.
 `lisp' and its subdirectories hold the Lisp code for the editing commands,
 `etc' holds various associated documentation files
    and programs that Emacs runs,
 `info' holds the Info documentation tree.
 `man' holds the source of the Emacs manual, and various other manuals.

The file INSTALL in this directory says how to bring up
 GNU Emacs on Unix, once you have loaded the entire subtree of this
 directory.

The files `build-install' and `Makefile' help automate the process of
 building and installing emacs.  The former is a shell script.  See
 INSTALL for more info.

The file PROBLEMS contains information on many common
 problems that occur in building, installing and running Emacs.

The `etc' subdirectory contains several other files,
 named in capital letters, which you should look at
 when installing GNU Emacs.

The file 'emacs.com' in this directory is for VMS.  It defines
 logical names and commands such as `emacs', so you must edit
 it to specify the file and directory names used on your machine.
 This file must be executed in each session to enable you to run
 the installed Emacs.  It should be executed by your `login.com' file,
 or else perhaps it can be executed once at system boot time.

The file `kepteditor.com' in this directory is also for VMS.
 When a user says to run Emacs, it really runs this command file.

See the files VMSINSTALL and VMSNOTES for more information on VMS use.
