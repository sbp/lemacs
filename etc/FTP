     Lucid GNU Emacs availability information.  Last Modified:  2-aug-93.

Lucid Emacs is available via anonymous FTP from LUCID.COM (192.43.175.3)
in the directory /pub/lemacs/.

Note that the IP address of LUCID.COM changed in mid-July, 1993; if you
cannot connect, check to see that you are picking up the correct address.

LUCID.COM is the primary distribution point, but you may find it at other
sites as well.  Such as ftp.uu.net in /systems/gnu/lucid/, liasun3.epfl.ch
in /pub/gnu/, and lkbreth.foretune.co.jp in /pub/GNU/lucid/.  If you would
like to make Lucid Emacs available for FTP from your site, please let us
know so that we can list your site here.

The LUCID.COM distribution (and copies of it) contain precompiled
executables for SunOS 4.1.  The Liasun3 distribution contains precompiled
executables for SGI as well.

There are mailing lists and newsgroups specifically for discussing and 
reporting bugs in Lucid GNU Emacs; see the file MAILINGLISTS in this
directory.

You can also purchase Lucid Emacs tapes and manuals directly from Lucid.
As of 17 march 93, the price is $400 for a bound Lucid Emacs manual and
a cartridge tape with sources and SunOS 4.x binaries, and $150 for the
manual alone.

To order, get current pricing information, or inquire about about other
media or platforms, call (800) 223-9322, or send electronic mail to
lucid-info@lucid.com.

Your input on what formats and architectures are desired will have an
impact on what we offer, so let us know what you want.

The FTP and ordering information in the remainder of this file applies
to the versions of GNU Emacs distributed by the Free Software Foundation,
not to Lucid Emacs.

How to get GNU Software by Internet FTP or by UUCP.  Last updated 21 Apr 93.

* Please send improvements to this file to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

* No Warranties

We distribute software in the hope that it will be useful, but without
any warranty.  No author or distributor of this software accepts
responsibility to anyone for the consequences of using it or for
whether it serves any particular purpose or works at all, unless he
says so in writing.

* Updates

If you find this file in the Emacs distribution, there is a chance it
is out of date.  If you plan to FTP files from prep.ai.mit.edu, you
might as well start by FTPing the current version of this file, which
is `/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP'.

* How to FTP

Use the ftp program on your system (ask locally if you can't find it)
to connect to the host you are ftping from.  Unless indicated
otherwise, login in as user "anonymous", with password: "your e-mail
address" and set "binary" mode (to transfer all eight bits in each
byte).

* FTPing GNU Software

** How to FTP GNU Emacs

If you are on the Internet (see also "** Alternative Internet FTP
Sources" below), you can at present copy the latest distribution
version of GNU Emacs from the file /pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar on host
prep.ai.mit.edu (or the file /pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar.gz which has been
run through gzip after tar).  M and N stand for version numbers; look
at a listing of the directory through ftp to see what version is
available.  These files are about 11 and 4 megabytes long,
respectively.  After you unpack the distribution, be sure to look at
the files README and INSTALL.

Because of difficulties in transferring large files, sometimes a split
version of the tar file is created.  This would be in a directory
named /pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar-split or perhaps
/pub/gnu/emacs-M.N.tar.gz-split, containing files of 100000 characters
each.  There is generally no trouble in ftping files of this size.
They can be combined with cat to make a tar file or compressed tar
file.  If you can't find such files on prep.ai.mit.edu, have a look at
archive.cis.ohio-state.edu.

ALWAYS USE BINARY/IMAGE MODE TO TRANSFER THESE FILES!
Text mode does not work for tar files or compressed files.

Some ftp'ers have found it necessary for successful file transfer:
   - to explicitly use prep.ai.mit.edu internet address:
18.71.0.38	(as of 11 April 89)

Files of differences from previous widely distributed GNU Emacs
versions to the present version are also available on prep.ai.mit.edu
under names of the form emacs.diff-OO.OO-NN.NN in directory /pub/gnu.
These are made with diff -rc2.  Sometimes there are versions
compressed with gzip of these difference files as well; their names
have .gz appended.

The Emacs manual in source form is included in the distribution.  The
dvi file produced by TeX is not included, but a copy may be available
for ftp under the name /pub/gnu/emacs.dvi.

The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual is in a separate file:
	/pub/gnu/elisp-manual-NN.tar.gz

** VMS versions of GNU Emacs and How To FTP It.
You can anonymously ftp a VMS version of GNU emacs from:
	- addvax.llnl.gov
	- VMSA.OAC.UCI.EDU or VMSD.OAC.UCI.EDU
	- RIGEL.EFD.LTH.SE [130.235.48.3]
	- ctrsci.cc.utah.edu - The 00readme.txt file gives details
	- cc.utah.edu [128.110.8.24], user anonymous, pass guest.  It
has already been compiled and linked so it is ready to run.  You will
need to ftp the reblock.for program to reblock the saveset so that the
backup utility can restore that saveset.  Do a backup/list on the
ftp'd saveset and catch the header info that backup puts out.  It
contains the correct block size to reblock the file to.  Remember to
ftp it in binary mode.

** A VMS version of GCC/G++ and How To FTP It.

mango.rsmas.miami.edu has a VMS version of the GCC/G++ compiler.
Contact angel@flipper.miami.edu (angel li) for details.

** Other GNU Software and How To FTP It.

Other GNU software is available on prep.ai.mit.edu under directory
/pub/gnu.  diff files to convert between versions (like those used for
GNU Emacs), exist for some of these programs.  Some programs have misc
support files as well.  Have a look on prep to see which ones.
Compressed versions of the tar or diff files are often available
(indicated by a .gz suffix and made with the `gzip' program).  Some of
this software is in beta test (probably still buggy), and is being
made available for use by hackers who like to test software.

The file /pub/gnu/DESCRIPTIONS has a list of the packages distributed
on prep.ai.mit.edu with a brief description explaining what
each one can be used for.

More information about these programs can typically be found in the
GNU Bulletin.  To receive a copy, write to gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu.

** TeX and How to FTP It

We don't distribute TeX now, but it is free software.

You can get TeX sources via anonymous FTP from labrea.stanford.edu in
pub/tex.  The directory pub/tex/unix3.0 probably contains what you
want, but see pub/tex/README to be sure.  The most recent incarnation
of the LaTeX macros are in labrea:pub/tex/latex.  If you'd like to
support TUG and/or don't have access to the Internet, then write to
elisabet@max.acs.washington.edu about getting their tape distribution.

** Scheme and How to FTP It

The latest distribution version of C Scheme is on the machine
zurich.ai.mit.edu.  To obtain a "tarred" copy of this directory,
telnet to zurich.ai.mit.edu and log in as scheme (password: scheme).
A file called dist.tar will be created (if there isn't one already),
and you will be given a choice of the file transfer program to run (of
all the ones supported by zurich).  It should be self-explanatory (ha,
ha!  [try ? for help]).

Read the files INSTALL and README in the top level C Scheme directory.

** Alternative Internet FTP Sources

The administrators of louie.udel.edu maintains copies of GNU Emacs.
The files are available via anonymous ftp under directory ~ftp/gnu.

Emacs and other GNU programs may be available via anonymous ftp from
these US sites: ftp.kpc.com:/pub/mirror/gnu (Silicon Valley, CA)
labrea.stanford.edu, wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/gnu,
col.hp.com:/mirrors/gnu, ftp.cs.columbia.edu:/archives/gnu/prep,
ftp.cs.widener.edu, itstd.sri.com, a.cs.uiuc.edu, uxc.cso.uiuc.edu,
scam.berkeley.edu, jaguar.utah.edu, gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/gnu,
archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, and ftp.uu.net:/archive/systems/gnu).  And
these foreign sites: archie.oz.au:/gnu (Australia (archie.oz or
archie.oz.au for ACSnet)), ftp.technion.ac.il:/pub/unsupported/gnu
(Israel, automatic update daily, ran by ftp-admin),
ftp.sun.ac.za:/pub/gnu (South Africa),
ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de or ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de
(Germany), isy.liu.se, ftp.stacken.kth.se or ftp.luth.se:/pub/unix/gnu
(Sweden), hp4nl.nluug.nl (Netherlands), ftp.win.tue.nl (Netherlands,
Internet Address 131.155.70.100), nic.funet.fi:/pub/gnu (Finland
128.214.6.100, ran by gnu-adm), ftp.denet.dk (Denmark), ugle.unit.no
(Norway 129.241.1.97), ftp.eunet.ch or nic.switch.ch:/mirror/gnu
(Switzerland), irisa.irisa.fr:/pub/gnu or grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/gnu
(France), archive.eu.net (Europe, 192.16.202.1),
cair.kaist.ac.kr:/pub/gnu (Korea 143.248.11.170),
utsun.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp:/ftpsync/prep or ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp (Japan,
nemacs, the japanese port of GNU Emacs, is under ~ftp/JAPAN).  Please
do NOT use a site outside your country, until you have checked all
sites inside your country, and then your continent.  Trans-ocean
TCP/IP links are very expensive and usually very low speed.

* Getting GNU software in Great Britain

jpo@cs.nott.ac.uk is willing to distribute those GNU sources he has
available.  The smaller items are available from the info-server (send
to info-server@cs.nott.ac.uk) the larger items by negotiation.  Due to
communication costs this service is only available within the UK.

BattenIG@computer-science.birmingham.ac.uk (aka
I.G.Batten@fulcrum.bt.co.uk) is also willing to distribute those GNU
sources he has.  He can also write tapes in qic-21 and qic-24 formats.

lmjm@doc.ic.ac.uk is willing to distribute those GNU sources he has
along with comp.sources.unix, comp.sources.x, X windows et al.  The
archive, on src.doc.ic.ac.uk in directory /gnu, is available via ftp
over the Internet (on 146.169.3.7), niftp over janet (000005102000),
ftam over IXI and uucp.  Due to communication costs this service is
only available within the UK.  Mail to info-server@doc.ic.ac.uk for
details.  He can also write sun cartridge or exabyte tapes.

These UK sites have just anonymous FTP access: ftp.mcc.ac.uk
