This directory contains some mu-law encoded SunOS 4.1 sound files.  

If you're running Lucid GNU Emacs on the console of a SparcStation, you
can use these sounds to replace the default beep.  See the documentation
of the `sound-alist' variable, and the functions `load-default-sounds' 
and `load-sound-file' from ../lisp/sound.el.
