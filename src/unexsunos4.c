/*
 * Unexec for Berkeley a.out format + SUNOS shared libraries
 * The unexeced executable contains the __DYNAMIC area from the
 * original text file,  and then the rest of data + bss + malloced area of
 * the current process.  (The __DYNAMIC area is at the top of the process
 * data segment,  we use "data_start" defined externally to mark the start
 * of the "real" data segment.)
 *
 * For programs that want to remap some of the data segment read only
 * a run_time_remap is provided.  This attempts to remap largest area starting
 * and ending on page boundaries between "data_start" and "bndry"
 * For this it to figure out where the text file is located.  A path search
 * is attempted after trying argv[0] and if all fails we simply do not remap
 *
 * One feature of run_time_remap () is mandatory:  reseting the break.
 *
 *  Note that we can no longer map data into the text segment,  as this causes
 *  the __DYNAMIC struct to become read only,  breaking the runtime loader.
 *  Thus we no longer need to mess with a private crt0.c,  the standard one
 *  will do just fine,  since environ can live in the writable area between
 *  __DYNAMIC and data_start,  just make sure that pre-crt0.o (the name
 *  is somewhat abused here) is loaded first!
