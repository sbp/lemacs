Read the file ../etc/NEWS before you do anything else.

Edit src/lwlib/Imakefile, read the comments, and define the symbols you 
want.  Note that the symbols LWLIB_HAS_EXTENSIONS, LWLIB_USES_MOTIF, and
LWLIB_USES_OLIT in src/config.h must correspond to the choices you made
in src/lwlib/Imakefile.  Imake comes with X.  If you don't have Imake, 
you'll have to hack up a Makefile for lwlib by hand.  

Lucid GNU Emacs requires an ANSI C compiler, like Lucid C/C++ or GCC.

Now all you should have to do is

cd src
make clean
make

If anything goes wrong, read the file ../PROBLEMS.

There have been a few incompatible changes due to the new input model, and
we have included modified versions of many popular emacs-lisp packages.  
Because of this, you will encounter problems if you try to run (for example)
the standard distribution of GNUS instead of the one we ship.  We hope to 
get our compatibility changes folded back into the main distribution of 
these packages eventually.

If you install emacs in such a way that an emacs18 lisp directory is searched
before the lisp directory shipped with this emacs, or if you do this with
your .emacs file, nothing will work.

If you are thinking of editing paths.h, think again.  Re-read ../etc/NEWS.
