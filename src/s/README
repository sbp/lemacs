This directory contains C header files containing
operating-system-specific definitions.  Each file describes a
particular operating system.  The emacs configuration script edits
../config.h to include the appropriate one of these files, and then
each emacs source file includes config.h.

template.h is a generic template for system descriptions; it describes
the parameters a system file can specify.

General Lucid Emacs Changes
---------------------------
The following is a list of those changes made globally across all
files.  They are not marked individually in each header file.  All
other changes should be preceeded by a comment /* lemacs change */.


1. Changed all defines of the type:

      #define [read|write|open|close] sys_[read|write|open|close]

      to

      #define emacs_[read|write|open|close] sys_[read|write|open|close]


   The revised comment is:

      /* On USG systems the system calls are interruptable by signals
	 that the user program has elected to catch.  Thus the system
	 call must be retried in these cases.  All calls to read,
	 write, and open in emacs are really calls to emacs_read, etc.
	 We define emacs_read to be sys_read (which is defined in
	 sysdep.c for this system.)  If these were not defined, they
	 would be defined to be open, etc.  We can't just "#define
	 open sys_open" because of prototype problems.  */


2. Removed all instances of #undef SIGIO and replaced them with
   #define BROKEN_SIGIO.  Jamie says:

   /* use BROKEN_SIGIO instead of this kludge -- jwz */


3.  All instances of HAVE_GETWD, HAVE_GETPAGESIZE, HAVE_DUP2,
    HAVE_UNISTD_H, HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY and NEED_REALPATH removed.  We
    detect these automatically with configure.

4.  All instances of HAVE_X11 replaced with HAVE_X_WINDOWS.  We don't
    support X10 or earlier so the HAVE_X11 define was purged.
