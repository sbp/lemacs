This directory contains the predefined dialog boxes and control panels 
used by Energize.  the ".xd" files are the XDesigner definitions of them.
The ".xdc" files are source code written by XDesigner.  "fidget-widget"
is a shell script that repairs some stupidity in the generated code;
we create ".c" files from the output of fidget-widget.  This stuff is
linked into lwlib.a, in the parent directory.
