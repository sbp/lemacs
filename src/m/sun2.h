/* The following line tells the configuration script what sort of 
   operating system this machine is likely to run.
   USUAL-OPSYS="note"

NOTE-START
Sun 1, 2 and 3 (-machine=sun1, -machine=sun2, -machine=sun3;
                -opsystem=bsd4-2 or -opsystem=sunos4)

  Whether you should use sun1, sun2 or sun3 depends on the
		   VERSION OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM
  you have.  There are three machine types for different versions of
  SunOS.  All are derived from Berkeley 4.2, meaning that you should
  use -opsystem=bsd4-2.  Emacs 17 has run on all of them.  You will
  need to use sun3 on Sun 2's running SunOS release 3.

  For SunOS release 4 on a Sun 3, use -machine=sun3 and
  -opsystem=sunos4.  See the file share-lib/SUNBUG for how to solve
  problems caused by bugs in the "export" version of SunOS 4.
