This directory contains C header files containing machine-specific
definitions.  Each file describes a particular machine.  The emacs
configuration script edits ../config.h to include the appropriate one of
these files, and then each emacs source file includes config.h.

template.h is a generic template for machine descriptions; it
describes the parameters a machine file can specify.


General Lucid Emacs Changes
---------------------------
1.  Removed all code dealing with VALBITS and XSET*.  These are handled
    differently in lemacs.

2.  Removed all defines of BIG_ENDIAN.  Now determined by configure.

See ../s/README for a list of other changes made to the FSF 19.22
configuration files for lemacs.
