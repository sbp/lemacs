File: emacs,  Node: Query Replace,  Prev: Replacement and Case,  Up: Replace

Query Replace
-------------

`M-% STRING RET NEWSTRING RET'
`M-x query-replace RET STRING RET NEWSTRING RET'
     Replace some occurrences of STRING with NEWSTRING.

`M-x query-replace-regexp RET REGEXP RET NEWSTRING RET'
     Replace some matches for REGEXP with NEWSTRING.

   If you want to change only some of the occurrences of `foo' to
`bar', not all of them, you can (`query-replace') instead of `M-%'. 
This command finds occurrences of `foo' one by one, displays each
occurrence, and asks you whether to replace it.  A numeric argument to
`query-replace' tells it to consider only occurrences that are bounded
by word-delimiter characters.

   Aside from querying, `query-replace' works just like
`replace-string', and `query-replace-regexp' works just like
`replace-regexp'.

   The things you can type when you are shown an occurrence of STRING
or a match for REGEXP are:

`SPC'
     to replace the occurrence with NEWSTRING.  This preserves case,
     just like `replace-string', provided `case-replace' is non-`nil',
     as it normally is.

`DEL'
     to skip to the next occurrence without replacing this one.

`, (Comma)'
     to replace this occurrence and display the result.  You are then
     prompted for another input character, however, since the
     replacement has already been made, DEL and SPC are equivalent. 
     At this point, you can type `C-r' (see below) to alter the
     replaced text.  To undo the replacement, you can type `C-x u'. 
     This exits the `query-replace'.  If you want to do further
     replacement you must use `C-x ESC' to restart (*note
     Repetition::.).

`ESC'
     to exit without doing any more replacements.

`. (Period)'
     to replace this occurrence and then exit.

`!'
     to replace all remaining occurrences without asking again.

`^'
     to go back to the location of the previous occurrence (or what
     used to be an occurrence), in case you changed it by mistake. 
     This works by popping the mark ring.  Only one `^' in a row is
     allowed, because only one previous replacement location is kept
     during `query-replace'.

`C-r'
     to enter a recursive editing level, in case the occurrence needs
     to be edited rather than just replaced with NEWSTRING.  When you
     are done, exit the recursive editing level with `C-M-c' and the
     next occurrence will be displayed.  *Note Recursive Edit::.

`C-w'
     to delete the occurrence, and then enter a recursive editing
     level as in `C-r'.  Use the recursive edit to insert text to
     replace the deleted occurrence of STRING.  When done, exit the
     recursive editing level with `C-M-c' and the next occurrence will
     be displayed.

`C-l'
     to redisplay the screen and then give another answer.

`C-h'
     to display a message summarizing these options, then give another
     answer.

   If you type any other character, Emacs exits the `query-replace',
and executes the character as a command.  To restart the
`query-replace', use `C-x ESC', which repeats the `query-replace'
because it used the minibuffer to read its arguments.  *Note C-x ESC:
Repetition.

Other Search-and-Loop Commands
==============================

   Here are some other commands that find matches for a regular
expression.  They all operate from point to the end of the buffer.

`M-x occur'
     Print each line that follows point and contains a match for the
     specified regexp.  A numeric argument specifies the number of
     context lines to print before and after each matching line; the
     default is none.

     The buffer `*Occur*' containing the output serves as a menu for
     finding occurrences in their original context.  Find an occurrence
     as listed in `*Occur*', position point there, and type `C-c C-c';
     this switches to the buffer that was searched and moves point to
     the original of the same occurrence.

`M-x list-matching-lines'
     Synonym for `M-x occur'.

`M-x count-matches'
     Print the number of matches following point for the specified
     regexp.

`M-x delete-non-matching-lines'
     Delete each line that follows point and does not contain a match
     for the specified regexp.

`M-x delete-matching-lines'
     Delete each line that follows point and contains a match for the
     specified regexp.

Commands for Fixing Typos
*************************

   This chapter describes commands that are especially useful when you
catch a mistake in your text just after you have made it, or change
your mind while composing text on line.

* Menu:

* Kill Errors:: Commands to kill a batch of recently entered text.
* Transpose::   Exchanging two characters, words, lines, lists...
* Fixing Case:: Correcting case of last word entered.
* Spelling::    Apply spelling checker to a word, or a whole file.


File: emacs,  Node: Kill Errors,  Next: Transpose,  Prev: Fixit,  Up: Fixit

Killing Your Mistakes
=====================

`DEL'
     Delete last character (`delete-backward-char').

`M-DEL'
     Kill last word (`backward-kill-word').

`C-x DEL'
     Kill to beginning of sentence (`backward-kill-sentence').

   The DEL character (`delete-backward-char') is the most important
correction command.  When used among graphic (self-inserting)
characters, it can be thought of as canceling the last character typed.

   When your mistake is longer than a couple of characters, it might
be more convenient to use `M-DEL' or `C-x DEL'.  `M-DEL' kills back to
the start of the last word, and `C-x DEL' kills back to the start of
the last sentence.  `C-x DEL' is particularly useful when you are
thinking of what to write as you type it, in case you change your mind
about phrasing.  `M-DEL' and `C-x DEL' save the killed text for `C-y'
and `M-y' to retrieve.  *Note Yanking::.

   `M-DEL' is often useful even when you have typed only a few
characters wrong, if you know you are confused in your typing and
aren't sure exactly what you typed.  At such a time, you cannot
correct with DEL except by looking at the screen to see what you did. 
It requires less thought to kill the whole word and start over.


File: emacs,  Node: Transpose,  Next: Fixing Case,  Prev: Kill Errors,  Up: Fixit

Transposing Text
================

`C-t'
     Transpose two characters (`transpose-chars').

`M-t'
     Transpose two words (`transpose-words').

`C-M-t'
     Transpose two balanced expressions (`transpose-sexps').

`C-x C-t'
     Transpose two lines (`transpose-lines').

   The common error of transposing two adjacent characters can be fixed
with the `C-t' command (`transpose-chars').  Normally, `C-t'
transposes the two characters on either side of point.  When given at
the end of a line, `C-t' transposes the last two characters on the
line, rather than transposing the last character of the line with the
newline, which would be useless.  If you catch a transposition error
right away, you can fix it with just `C-t'.  If you catch the error
later,  move the cursor back to between the two transposed characters.
 If you transposed a space with the last character of the word before
it, the word motion commands are a good way of getting there. 
Otherwise, a reverse search (`C-r') is often the best way.  *Note
Search::.

   `Meta-t' (`transpose-words') transposes the word before point with
the word after point.  It moves point forward over a word, dragging
the word preceding or containing point forward as well.  The
punctuation characters between the words do not move.  For example,
`FOO, BAR' transposes into `BAR, FOO' rather than `BAR FOO,'.

   `C-M-t' (`transpose-sexps') is a similar command for transposing
two expressions (*note Lists::.), and `C-x C-t' (`transpose-lines')
exchanges lines.  It works like `M-t' but in determins the division of
the text into syntactic units differently.

   A numeric argument to a transpose command serves as a repeat count:
it tells the transpose command to move the character (word, sexp,
line) before or containing point across several other characters
(words, sexps, lines).  For example, `C-u 3 C-t' moves the character
before point forward across three other characters.  This is
equivalent to repeating `C-t' three times.  `C-u - 4 M-t' moves the
word before point backward across four words.  `C-u - C-M-t' would
cancel the effect of plain `C-M-t'.

   A numeric argument of zero transposes the character (word, sexp,
line) ending after point with the one ending after the mark (otherwise
a command with a repeat count of zero would do nothing).

Case Conversion
===============

`M-- M-l'
     Convert last word to lower case.  Note `Meta--' is Meta-minus.

`M-- M-u'
     Convert last word to all upper case.

`M-- M-c'
     Convert last word to lower case with capital initial.

   A  common error is to type words in the wrong case.  Because of
this, the word case-conversion commands `M-l', `M-u' and `M-c' do not
move the cursor when used with a negative argument.  As soon as you
see you have mistyped the last word, you can simply case-convert it
and continue typing.  *Note Case::.


File: emacs,  Node: Spelling,  Prev: Fixing Case,  Up: Fixit

Checking and Correcting Spelling
================================

`M-$'
     Check and correct spelling of word (`spell-word').

`M-x spell-buffer'
     Check and correct spelling of each word in the buffer.

`M-x spell-region'
     Check and correct spelling of each word in the region.

`M-x spell-string'
     Check spelling of specified word.

   To check the spelling of the word before point, and optionally
correct it, use the command `M-$' (`spell-word').  This command runs an
inferior process containing the `spell' program to see whether the
word is correct English.  If it is not, it asks you to edit the word
(in the minibuffer) into a corrected spelling, and then performs a
`query-replace' to substitute the corrected spelling for the old one
throughout the buffer.

   If you exit the minibuffer without altering the original spelling,
it means you do not want to do anything to that word.  In that case,
the `query-replace' is not done.

   `M-x spell-buffer' checks each word in the buffer the same way that
`spell-word' does, doing a `query-replace' for every incorrect word if
appropriate.

   `M-x spell-region' is similar to `spell-buffer' but operates only
on the region, not the entire buffer.

   `M-x spell-string' reads a string as an argument and checks whether
that is a correctly spelled English word.  It prints a message giving
the answer in the echo area.

File Handling
*************

   The basic unit of stored data in Unix is the "file".  To edit a
file, you must tell Emacs to examine the file and prepare a buffer
containing a copy of the file's text.  This is called "visiting" the
file.  Editing commands apply directly to text in the buffer; that is,
to the copy inside Emacs.  Your changes appear in the file itself only
when you "save" the buffer back into the file.

   In addition to visiting and saving files, Emacs can delete, copy,
rename, and append to files, and operate on file directories.

* Menu:

* File Names::   How to type and edit file name arguments.
* Visiting::     Visiting a file prepares Emacs to edit the file.
* Saving::       Saving makes your changes permanent.
* Reverting::    Reverting cancels all the changes not saved.
* Auto Save::    Auto Save periodically protects against loss of data.
* ListDir::      Listing the contents of a file directory.
* Dired::        "Editing" a directory to delete, rename, etc.
                  the files in it.
* Misc File Ops:: Other things you can do on files.


File: emacs,  Node: File Names,  Next: Visiting,  Prev: Files,  Up: Files

File Names
==========

   Most Emacs commands that operate on a file require you to specify
the file name.  (Saving and reverting are exceptions; the buffer knows
which file name to use for them.)  File names are specified in the
minibuffer (*note Minibuffer::.).  "Completion" is available, to make
it easier to specify long file names.  *Note Completion::.

   There is always a "default file name" which is used if you enter an
empty argument by typing just RET.  Normally the default file name is
the name of the file visited in the current buffer; this makes it easy
to operate on that file with any of the Emacs file commands.

   Each buffer has a default directory, normally the same as the
directory of the file visited in that buffer.  When Emacs reads a file
name, the default directory is used if you do not specify a directory. 
If you specify a directory in a relative fashion, with a name that does
not start with a slash, it is interpreted with respect to the default
directory.  The default directory is kept in the variable
`default-directory', which has a separate value in every buffer.

   For example, if the default file name is `/u/rms/gnu/gnu.tasks' then
the default directory is `/u/rms/gnu/'.  If you type just `foo', which
does not specify a directory, it is short for `/u/rms/gnu/foo'. 
`../.login' would stand for `/u/rms/.login'.  `new/foo' would stand
for the filename `/u/rms/gnu/new/foo'.

   The command `M-x pwd' prints the current buffer's default directory,
and the command `M-x cd' sets it (to a value read using the
minibuffer).  A buffer's default directory changes only when the `cd'
command is used.  A file-visiting buffer's default directory is
initialized to the directory of the file that is visited there.  If a
buffer is created with `C-x b', its default directory is copied from
that of the buffer that was current at the time.

   The default directory name actually appears in the minibuffer when
the minibuffer becomes active to read a file name.  This serves two
purposes: it shows you what the default is, so that you can type a
relative file name and know with certainty what it will mean, and it
allows you to edit the default to specify a different directory.  To
inhibit the insertion of the default directory, set the variable
`insert-default-directory' to `nil'.

   Note that it is legitimate to type an absolute file name after you
enter the minibuffer, ignoring the presence of the default directory
name.  The final minibuffer contents may look invalid, but that is not
so.  *Note Minibuffer File::.

   `$' in a file name is used to substitute environment variables.  For
example, if you have used the shell command `setenv FOO rms/hacks' to
set up an environment variable named `FOO', then you can use
`/u/$FOO/test.c' or `/u/${FOO}/test.c' as an abbreviation for
`/u/rms/hacks/test.c'.  The environment variable name consists of all
the alphanumeric characters after the `$'; alternatively, it may be
enclosed in braces after the `$'.  Note that the `setenv' command
affects Emacs only if done before Emacs is started.

   To access a file with `$' in its name, type `$$'.  This pair is
converted to a single `$' at the same time variable substitution is
performed for single `$'.  The Lisp function that performs the
substitution is called `substitute-in-file-name'.  The substitution is
performed only on filenames read as such using the minibuffer.


File: emacs,  Node: Visiting,  Next: Saving,  Prev: File Names,  Up: Files

Visiting Files
==============

`C-x C-f'
     Visit a file (`find-file').

`C-x C-v'
     Visit a different file instead of the one visited last
     (`find-alternate-file').

`C-x 4 C-f'
     Visit a file, in another window (`find-file-other-window').  Don't
     change this window.

   "Visiting" a file means copying its contents into an Emacs buffer
so you can edit it.  Emacs creates a new buffer for each file you
visit.  We say that the buffer is visiting the file that it was created
to hold.  Emacs constructs the buffer name from the file name by
throwing away the directory, keeping just the file name.  For example,
a file named `/usr/rms/emacs.tex' would get a buffer named
`emacs.tex'.  If there is already a buffer with that name, a unique
name is constructed by appending `<2>', `<3>',and so on, using the
lowest number that makes a name that is not already in use.

   Each window's mode line shows the name of the buffer that is being
displayed in that window, so you can always tell what buffer you are
editing.

   The changes you make with Emacs are made in the Emacs buffer.  They
do not take effect in the file that you visit, or any other permanent
place, until you "save" the buffer.  Saving the buffer means that
Emacs writes the current contents of the buffer into its visited file. 
*Note Saving::.

   If a buffer contains changes that have not been saved, the buffer
is said to be "modified".  This is important because it implies that
some changes will be lost if the buffer is not saved.  The mode line
displays two stars near the left margin if the buffer is modified.

   To visit a file, use the command `C-x C-f' (`find-file').  Follow
the command with the name of the file you wish to visit, terminated by
a RET.  If you are using Lucid GNU Emacs under X, you can also use the
Open File... command from the File menu bar item.

   The file name is read using the minibuffer (*note Minibuffer::.),
with defaulting and completion in the standard manner (*note File
Names::.).  While in the minibuffer, you can abort `C-x C-f' by typing
`C-g'.

   You know that `C-x C-f' has completed successfully when text
appears on the screen and a new buffer name appears in the mode line. 
If the specified file does not exist and could not be created, or
cannot be read, an error results.  The error message is printed in the
echo area, and includes the name of the file which Emacs was trying to
visit.

   If you visit a file that is already in Emacs, `C-x C-f' does not
make another copy.  It selects the existing buffer containing that
file.  However, before doing so, it checks that the file itself has
not changed since you visited or saved it last.  If the file has
changed, Emacs prints a warning message.  *Note Simultaneous Editing:
Interlocking.

   If you want to create a file, just visit it.  Emacs prints `(New
File)' in the echo area, but in other respects behaves as if you had
visited an existing empty file.  If you make any changes and save them,
the file is created.

   If you visit a nonexistent file unintentionally (because you typed
the wrong file name), use the `C-x C-v' (`find-alternate-file')
command to visit the file you wanted.  `C-x C-v' is similar to `C-x
C-f', but it kills the current buffer (after first offering to save it
if it is modified).  `C-x C-v' is allowed even if the current buffer
is not visiting a file.

   If the file you specify is actually a directory, Dired is called on
that directory (*note Dired::.).  To inhibit this, set  the variable
`find-file-run-dired' to `nil'; then it is an error to try to visit a
directory.

   `C-x 4 f' (`find-file-other-window') is like `C-x C-f' except that
the buffer containing the specified file is selected in another
window.  The window that was selected before `C-x 4 f' continues to
show the same buffer it was already showing.  If you use this command
when only one window is being displayed, that window is split in two,
with one window showing the same buffer as before, and the other one
showing the newly requested file.  *Note Windows::.

   There are two hook variables that allow extensions to modify the
operation of visiting files.  Visiting a file that does not exist runs
the functions in the list `find-file-not-found-hooks'; the value of
this variable is expected to be a list of functions which are called
one by one until one of them returns non-`nil'.  Any visiting of a
file, whether extant or not, expects `find-file-hooks' to contain list
of functions and calls them all, one by one.  In both cases the
functions receive no arguments.  Visiting a nonexistent file runs the
`find-file-not-found-hooks' first.

Saving Files
============

   "Saving" a buffer in Emacs means writing its contents back into the
file that was visited in the buffer.

`C-x C-s'
     Save the current buffer in its visited file (`save-buffer').

`C-x s'
     Save any or all buffers in their visited files
     (`save-some-buffers').

`M-~'
     Forget that the current buffer has been changed (`not-modified').

`C-x C-w'
     Save the current buffer in a specified file, and record that file
     as the one visited in the buffer (`write-file').

`M-x set-visited-file-name'
     Change file the name under which the current buffer will be saved.

   To save a file and make your changes permanent, type `C-x C-s'
(`save-buffer').  After saving is finished, `C-x C-s' prints a message
like

     Wrote /u/rms/gnu/gnu.tasks

If the selected buffer is not modified (no changes have been made in it
since the buffer was created or last saved), Emacs does not save it
because it would have no effect.  Instead, `C-x C-s' prints a message
in the echo area saying

     (No changes need to be written)

   The command `C-x s' (`save-some-buffers') can save any or all
modified buffers.  First it asks, for each modified buffer, whether to
save it.  The questions should be answered with `y' or `n'.  `C-x
C-c', the key that kills Emacs, invokes `save-some-buffers' and
therefore asks the same questions.

   If you have changed a buffer and do not want the changes to be
saved, you should take some action to prevent it.  Otherwise, you are
liable to save it by mistake each time you use `save-some-buffers' or a
related command.  One thing you can do is type `M-~' (`not-modified'),
which removes the indication that the buffer is modified.  If you do
this, none of the save commands will believe that the buffer needs to
be saved.  (`~' is often used as a mathematical symbol for `not'; thus
`Meta-~' is `not', metafied.) You could also use
`set-visited-file-name' (see below) to mark the buffer as visiting a
different file name, not in use for anything important.

   You can also undo all the changes made since the file was visited or
saved, by reading the text from the file again.  This is called
"reverting".  *Note Reverting::.  Alternatively, you can undo all the
changes by repeating the undo command `C-x u'; but this only works if
you have not made more changes than the undo mechanism can remember.

   `M-x set-visited-file-name' alters the name of the file that the
current buffer is visiting.  It prompts you for the new file name in
the minibuffer.  You can also use `set-visited-file-name' on a buffer
that is not visiting a file.  The buffer's name is changed to
correspond to the file it is now visiting unless the new name is
already used by a different buffer; in that case, the buffer name is
not changed.  `set-visited-file-name' does not save the buffer in the
newly visited file; it just alters the records inside Emacs so that it
will save the buffer in that file.  It also marks the buffer as
"modified" so that `C-x C-s' will save.

   If you wish to mark a buffer as visiting a different file and save
it right away, use `C-x C-w' (`write-file').  It is precisely
equivalent to `set-visited-file-name' followed by `C-x C-s'.  `C-x
C-s' used on a buffer that is not visiting  a file has the same effect
as `C-x C-w'; that is, it reads a file name, marks the buffer as
visiting that file, and saves it there.  The default file name in a
buffer that is not visiting a file is made by combining the buffer name
with the buffer's default directory.

   If Emacs is about to save a file and sees that the date of the
latest version on disk does not match what Emacs last read or wrote,
Emacs notifies you of this fact, because it probably indicates a
problem caused by simultaneous editing and requires your immediate
attention.  *Note Simultaneous Editing: Interlocking.

   If the variable `require-final-newline' is non-`nil', Emacs puts a
newline at the end of any file that doesn't already end in one, every
time a file is saved or written.

   Use the hook variable `write-file-hooks' to implement other ways to
write files, and specify things to be done before files are written. 
The value of this variable should be a list of Lisp functions.  When a
file is to be written, the functions in the list are called, one by
one, with no arguments.  If one of them returns a non-`nil' value,
Emacs takes this to mean that the file has been written in some
suitable fashion; the rest of the functions are not called, and normal
writing is not done.

* Menu:

* Backup::       How Emacs saves the old version of your file.
* Interlocking:: How Emacs protects against simultaneous editing
                  of one file by two users.

Backup Files
------------

   Because Unix does not provide version numbers in file names,
rewriting a file in Unix automatically destroys all record of what the
file used to contain.  Thus, saving a file from Emacs throws away the
old contents of the file--or it would, except that Emacs carefully
copies the old contents to another file, called the "backup" file,
before actually saving.  (Provided the variable `make-backup-files' is
non-`nil'.  Backup files are not written if this variable is `nil').

   At your option, Emacs can keep either a single backup file or a
series of numbered backup files for each file you edit.

   Emacs makes a backup for a file only the first time a file is saved
from one buffer.  No matter how many times you save a file, its backup
file continues to contain the contents from before the file was
visited.  Normally this means that the backup file contains the
contents from before the current editing session; however, if you kill
the buffer and then visit the file again, a new backup file is made by
the next save.

* Menu:

* Names: Backup Names.		How backup files are named;

* Deletion: Backup Deletion.	Emacs deletes excess numbered backups.
* Copying: Backup Copying.	Backups can be made by copying or renaming.

Single or Numbered Backups
..........................

   If you choose to have a single backup file (the default), the
backup file's name is constructed by appending `~' to the file name
being edited; thus, the backup file for `eval.c' is `eval.c~'.

   If you choose to have a series of numbered backup files, backup file
names are made by appending `.~', the number, and another `~' to the
original file name.  Thus, the backup files of `eval.c' would be
called `eval.c.~1~', `eval.c.~2~', and so on, through names like
`eval.c.~259~' and beyond.

   If protection stops you from writing backup files under the usual
names, the backup file is written as `%backup%~' in your home
directory.  Only one such file can exist, so only the most recently
made backup is available.

   The choice of single backup or numbered backups is controlled by the
variable `version-control'.  Its possible values are

`t'
     Make numbered backups.

`nil'
     Make numbered backups for files that have numbered backups
     already.  Otherwise, make single backups.

`never'
     Never make numbered backups; always make single backups.

`version-control' may be set locally in an individual buffer to
control the making of backups for that buffer's file.  For example,
Rmail mode locally sets `version-control' to `never' to make sure that
there is only one backup for an Rmail file.  *Note Locals::.

Automatic Deletion of Backups
.............................

   To prevent unlimited consumption of disk space, Emacs can delete
numbered backup versions automatically.  Generally Emacs keeps the
first few backups and the latest few backups, deleting any in between.
 This happens every time a new backup is made.  The two variables that
control the deletion are `kept-old-versions' and `kept-new-versions'. 
Their values are, respectively the number of oldest (lowest-numbered)
backups to keep and the number of newest (highest-numbered) ones to
keep, each time a new backup is made.  The values are used just after
a new backup version is made; that newly made backup is included in
the count in `kept-new-versions'.  By default, both variables are 2.

   If `trim-versions-without-asking' is non-`nil',  excess middle
versions are deleted without notification.  If it is `nil', the
default, you are asked whether the excess middle versions should
really be deleted.

   You can also use Dired's `.' (Period) command to delete old
versions.  *Note Dired::.


File: emacs,  Node: Backup Copying,  Prev: Backup Deletion,  Up: Backup

Copying vs. Renaming
....................

   You can make backup files by copying the old file or by renaming it. 
This makes a difference when the old file has multiple names.  If you
rename the old file into the backup file, the alternate names become
names for the backup file.  If you copy the old file instead, the
alternate names remain names for the file that you are editing, and
the contents accessed by those names will be the new contents.

   How you make a backup file may also affect the file's owner and
group.  If you use copying, they do not change.  If renaming is used,
you become the file's owner, and the file's group becomes the default
(different operating systems have different defaults for the group).

   Having the owner change is usually a good idea, because then the
owner always shows who last edited the file.  The owners of the
backups show who produced them.  Occasionally there is a file whose
owner should not change.  Since most files` owner should change, it is
a good idea to use local variable lists to set
`backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' for the special cases where the
owner should change.(*note File Variables::.).

   Three variables control the choice of renaming or copying. 
Normally, renaming is done.  If the variable `backup-by-copying' is
non-`nil', copying is used.  Otherwise, if the variable
`backup-by-copying-when-linked' is non-`nil', copying is done for
files that have multiple names, but renaming may still be done when
the file being edited has only one name.  If the variable
`backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' is non-`nil', copying is done if
renaming would cause the file's owner or group to change.

Protection against Simultaneous Editing
---------------------------------------

   Simultaneous editing occurs when two users visit the same file, both
make changes, and both save their changes.  If nobody were informed
that this was happening, and you saved first, you would later find
that your changes were lost.  On some systems, Emacs notices
immediately when the second user starts to change a file already being
edited, and issues a warning.  When this is not possible, or if the
second user has started to change the file despite the warning, Emacs
checks when the file is saved, and issues a second warning when a user
is about to overwrite a file containing another user's changes.  If
you are the user editing the file, you can take corrective action at
this point and prevent actual loss of work.

   When you make the first modification in an Emacs buffer that is
visiting a file, Emacs records that you have locked the file.  (It
does this by writing another file in a directory reserved for this
purpose.)  The lock is removed when you save the changes.  The idea is
that the file is locked whenever the buffer is modified.  If you begin
to modify the buffer while the visited file is locked by someone else,
this constitutes a collision, and Emacs asks you what to do.  It does
this by calling the Lisp function `ask-user-about-lock', which you can
redefine to customize what it does.  The standard definition of this
function asks you a question and accepts three possible answers:

`s'
     Steal the lock.  Whoever was already changing the file loses the
     lock, and you get the lock.

`p'
     Proceed.  Go ahead and edit the file despite its being locked by
     someone else.

`q'
     Quit.  This causes an error (`file-locked') and the modification
     you were trying to make in the buffer does not actually take
     place.

   Note that locking works on the basis of a file name; if a file has
multiple names, Emacs does not realize that the two names are the same
file and cannot prevent two users from editing it simultaneously under
different names.  However, basing locking on names means that Emacs
can interlock the editing of new files that do not really exist until
they are saved.

   Some systems are not configured to allow Emacs to make locks.  On
these systems, Emacs cannot detect trouble in advance, but it can still
detect it in time to prevent you from overwriting someone else's
changes.

   Every time Emacs saves a buffer, it first checks the
last-modification date of the existing file on disk to see that it has
not changed since the file was last visited or saved.  If the date
does not match, it implies that changes were made in the file in some
other way, and these changes are about to be lost if Emacs actually
does save.  To prevent this, Emacs prints a warning message and asks
for confirmation before saving.  Occasionally you will know why the
file was changed and know that it does not matter; then you can answer
`yes' and proceed.  Otherwise, you should cancel the save with `C-g'
and investigate the situation.

   The first thing you should do when notified that simultaneous
editing has already taken place is to list the directory with `C-u C-x
C-d' (*note Directory Listing: ListDir.).  This will show the file's
current author.  You should attempt to contact that person and ask her
not to continue editing.  Often the next step is to save the contents
of your Emacs buffer under a different name, and use `diff' to compare
the two files.

   Simultaneous editing checks are also made when you visit a file that
is already visited with `C-x C-f' and when you start to modify a file.
 This is not strictly necessary, but it is useful to find out about
such a problem as early as possible, when corrective action takes less
work.

Reverting a Buffer
==================

   If you have made extensive changes to a file and then change your
mind about them, you can get rid of all changes by reading in the
previous version of the file.  To do this, use `M-x revert-buffer',
which operates on the current buffer.  Since reverting a buffer can
result in very extensive changes, you must confirm it with `yes'.

   If the current buffer has been auto-saved more recently than it has
been saved explicitly, `revert-buffer' offers to read the auto save
file instead of the visited file (*note Auto Save::.).  Emacs asks you
about the auto save file before the request for confirmation of the
`revert-buffer' operation, and demands `y' or `n' as an answer.  If
you have started to type `yes' for confirmation without realizing that
the auto-save question was going to be asked, the `y' will answer that
question, but the `es' will not be valid confirmation.  This gives you
a chance to cancel the operation with `C-g' and try again with the
answers you really intend.

   `revert-buffer' keeps point at the same distance (measured in
characters) from the beginning of the file.  If the file was edited
only slightly, you will be at approximately the same piece of text
after reverting as before.  If you have made more extensive changes,
the value of point in the old file may bring you to a totally
different piece of text than your last editing point.

   A buffer reverted from its visited file is marked "not modified"
until you make a change.

   Some kinds of buffers whose contents reflect data bases other than
files, such as Dired buffers, can also be reverted.  For them,
reverting means recalculating their contents from the appropriate
data.  Buffers created randomly with `C-x b' cannot be reverted;
`revert-buffer' reports an error when asked to do so.

Auto-Saving: Protection Against Disasters
=========================================

   Emacs saves all the visited files from time to time (based on
counting your keystrokes) without being asked.  This is called
"auto-saving".  It prevents you from losing more than a limited amount
of work if the system crashes.

   When Emacs determines it is time for auto-saving, each buffer is
considered, and is auto-saved if auto-saving is turned on for it and
it has changed since the last time it was auto-saved.  If any
auto-saving is done, the message `Auto-saving...' is displayed in the
echo area until auto-saving is finished.  Errors occurring during
auto-saving are caught so that they do not interfere with the
execution of commands you have been typing.

* Menu:

* Files: Auto Save Files.
* Control: Auto Save Control.
* Recover::		Recovering text from auto-save files.


File: emacs,  Node: Auto Save Files,  Next: Auto Save Control,  Prev: Auto Save,  Up: Auto Save

Auto-Save Files
---------------

   Auto-saving does not normally write to the files you visited,
because it can be undesirable to save a program that is in an
inconsistent state when you have made only half of a planned change. 
Instead, auto-saving is done in a different file called the "auto-save
file", and the visited file is changed only when you save explicitly,
for example, with `C-x C-s'.

   Normally, the name of the auto-save file is generated by appending
`#' to the front and back of the visited file name.  Thus, a buffer
visiting file `foo.c' would be auto-saved in a file `#foo.c#'.  Most
buffers that are not visiting files are auto-saved only if you request
it explicitly; when they are auto-saved, the auto-save file name is
generated by appending `#%' to the front and `#' to the back of buffer
name.  For example, the `*mail*' buffer in which you compose messages
to be sent is auto-saved in a file named `#%*mail*#'.  Names of
auto-save files are generated this way unless you customize the
functions `make-auto-save-file-name' and `auto-save-file-name-p' to do
something different.  The file name to be used for auto-saving a
buffer is calculated at the time auto-saving is turned on in that
buffer.

   If you want auto-saving to be done in the visited file, set the
variable `auto-save-visited-file-name' to be non-`nil'.  In this mode,
there is really no difference between auto-saving and explicit saving.

   Emacs deletes a buffer's auto-save file when you explicitly save the
buffer.  To inhibit the deletion, set the variable
`delete-auto-save-files' to `nil'.  Changing the visited file name
with `C-x C-w' or `set-visited-file-name' renames any auto-save file
to correspond to the new visited name.


File: emacs,  Node: Auto Save Control,  Next: Recover,  Prev: Auto Save Files,  Up: Auto Save

Controlling Auto-Saving
-----------------------

   Each time you visit a file, auto-saving is turned on for that file's
buffer if the variable `auto-save-default' is non-`nil' (but not in
batch mode; *note Entering Emacs::.).  The default for this variable
is `t', so Emacs auto-saves buffers that visit files by default.  You
can use the command `M-x auto-save-mode' to turn auto-saving for a
buffer on or off.  Like other minor mode commands, `M-x
auto-save-mode' turns auto-saving on with a positive argument, off
with a zero or negative argument; with no argument, it toggles.

   Emacs performs auto-saving periodically based on counting how many
characters you have typed since the last time auto-saving happened. 
The variable `auto-save-interval' specifies the number of characters
between auto-saves.  By default, it is 300.  Emacs also auto-saves
whenever you call the function `do-auto-save'.

   Emacs also does auto-saving whenever it gets a fatal error.  This
includes killing the Emacs job with a shell command such as `kill
%emacs', or disconnecting a phone line or network connection.


File: emacs,  Node: Recover,  Prev: Auto Save Control,  Up: Auto Save

Recovering Data from Auto-Saves
-------------------------------

   If you want to use the contents of an auto-save file to recover
from a loss of data, use the command `M-x recover-file RET FILE RET'. 
Emacs visits FILE and then (after your confirmation) restores the
contents from the auto-save file `#FILE#'.  You can then save the file
with `C-x C-s' to put the recovered text into FILE itself.  For
example, to recover file `foo.c' from its auto-save file `#foo.c#', do:

     M-x recover-file RET foo.c RET
     C-x C-s

   Before asking for confirmation, `M-x recover-file' displays a
directory listing describing the specified file and the auto-save file,
so you can compare their sizes and dates.  If the auto-save file is
older, `M-x recover-file' does not offer to read it.

   Auto-saving is disabled by `M-x recover-file' because using this
command implies that the auto-save file contains valuable data from a
past session.  If you save the data in the visited file and then go on
to make new changes, turn auto-saving back on with `M-x
auto-save-mode'.

Listing a File Directory
========================

   Files are classified by Unix into "directories".  A "directory
listing" is a list of all the files in a directory.  Emacs provides
directory listings in brief format (file names only) and verbose format
(sizes, dates, and authors included).

`C-x C-d DIR-OR-PATTERN'
     Print a brief directory listing (`list-directory').

`C-u C-x C-d DIR-OR-PATTERN'
     Print a verbose directory listing.

   To print a directory listing, use `C-x C-d' (`list-directory'). 
This command prompts in the minibuffer for a file name which is either
a  directory to be listed or pattern containing wildcards for the
files to be listed.  For example,

     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/etc RET

lists all the files in directory `/u2/emacs/etc'.  An example of
specifying a file name pattern is

     C-x C-d /u2/emacs/src/*.c RET

   Normally, `C-x C-d' prints a brief directory listing containing just
file names.  A numeric argument (regardless of value) tells it to
print a verbose listing (like `ls -l').

   Emacs obtains the text of a directory listing by running `ls' in an
inferior process.  Two Emacs variables control the switches passed to
`ls': `list-directory-brief-switches' is a string giving the switches
to use in brief listings (`"-CF"' by default). 
`list-directory-verbose-switches' is a string giving the switches to
use in a verbose listing (`"-l"' by default).

Dired, the Directory Editor
===========================

   Dired makes it easy to delete or visit many of the files in a single
directory at once.  It makes an Emacs buffer containing a listing of
the directory.  You can use the normal Emacs commands to move around
in this buffer, and special Dired commands to operate on the files.

* Menu:

* Enter: Dired Enter.         How to invoke Dired.
* Edit: Dired Edit.           Editing the Dired buffer.
* Deletion: Dired Deletion.   Deleting files with Dired.

File: emacs,  Node: Dired Enter,  Next: Dired Edit,  Prev: Dired,  Up: Dired

Entering Dired
--------------

   To invoke dired, type `C-x d' or `M-x dired'.  The command reads a
directory name or wildcard file name pattern as a minibuffer argument
just like the `list-directory' command, `C-x C-d'.  Where `dired'
differs from `list-directory' is in naming the buffer after the
directory name or the wildcard pattern used for the listing, and
putting the buffer into Dired mode so that the special commands of
Dired are available in it.  The variable `dired-listing-switches' is a
string used as an argument to `ls' in making the directory; this string
must contain `-l'.

   To display the Dired buffer in another window rather than in the
selected window, use `C-x 4 d' (`dired-other-window)' instead of `C-x
d'.


File: emacs,  Node: Dired Edit,  Next: Dired Deletion,  Prev: Dired Enter,  Up: Dired

Editing in Dired
----------------

   Once the Dired buffer exists, you can switch freely between it and
other Emacs buffers.  Whenever the Dired buffer is selected, certain
special commands are provided that operate on files that are listed. 
The Dired buffer is "read-only", and inserting text in it is not
useful, so ordinary printing characters such as `d' and `x' are used
for Dired commands.  Most Dired commands operate on the file described
by the line that point is on.  Some commands perform operations
immediately; others "flag" the file to be operated on later.

   Most Dired commands that operate on the current line's file also
treat a numeric argument as a repeat count, meaning to act on the
files of the next few lines.  A negative argument means to operate on
the files of the preceding lines, and leave point on the first of
those lines.

   All the usual Emacs cursor motion commands are available in Dired
buffers.  Some special purpose commands are also provided.  The keys
`C-n' and `C-p' are redefined so that they try to position the cursor
at the beginning of the filename on the line, rather than at the
beginning of the line.

   For extra convenience, SPC and `n' in Dired are equivalent to
`C-n'.  `p' is equivalent to `C-p'.  Moving by lines is done so often
in Dired that it deserves to be easy to type.  DEL (move up and
unflag) is often useful simply for moving up.

   The `g' command in Dired runs `revert-buffer' to reinitialize the
buffer from the actual disk directory and show any changes made in the
directory by programs other than Dired.  All deletion flags in the
Dired buffer are lost when this is done.


File: emacs,  Node: Dired Deletion,  Next: Dired Immed,  Prev: Dired Edit,  Up: Dired

Deleting Files with Dired
-------------------------

   The primary use of Dired is to flag files for deletion and then
delete them.

`d'
     Flag this file for deletion.

`u'
     Remove deletion-flag on this line.

`DEL'
     Remove deletion-flag on previous line, moving point to that line.

`x'
     Delete the files that are flagged for deletion.

`#'
     Flag all auto-save files (files whose names start and end with
     `#') for deletion (*note Auto Save::.).

`~'
     Flag all backup files (files whose names end with `~') for
     deletion (*note Backup::.).

`. (Period)'
     Flag excess numeric backup files for deletion.  The oldest and
     newest few backup files of any one file are exempt; the middle
     ones are flagged.

   You can flag a file for deletion by moving to the line describing
the file and typing `d' or `C-d'.  The deletion flag is visible as a
`D' at the beginning of the line.  Point is moved to the beginning of
the next line, so that repeated `d' commands flag successive files.

   The files are flagged for deletion rather than deleted immediately
to avoid the danger of deleting a file accidentally.  Until you direct
Dired to delete the flagged files, you can remove deletion flags using
the commands `u' and DEL.  `u' works just like `d', but removes flags
rather than making flags.  DEL moves upward, removing flags; it is
like `u' with numeric argument automatically negated.

   To delete the flagged files, type `x'.  This command first displays
a list of all the file names flagged for deletion, and requests
confirmation with `yes'.  Once you confirm, all the flagged files are
deleted, and their lines are deleted from the text of the Dired
buffer.  The shortened Dired buffer remains selected.  If you answer
`no' or quit with `C-g', you return immediately to Dired, with the
deletion flags still present and no files actually deleted.

   The `#', `~' and `.' commands flag many files for deletion, based
on their names.  These commands are useful precisely because they do
not actually delete any files; you can remove the deletion flags from
any flagged files that you really wish to keep.

   `#' flags for deletion all files that appear to have been made by
auto-saving (that is, files whose names begin and end with `#').  `~'
flags for deletion all files that appear to have been made as backups
for files that were edited (that is, files whose names end with `~').

   `.' (Period) flags just some of the backup files for deletion: only
numeric backups that are not among the oldest few nor the newest few
backups of any one file.  Normally `dired-kept-versions' (not
`kept-new-versions'; that applies only when saving) specifies the
number of newest versions of each file to keep, and
`kept-old-versions' specifies the number of oldest versions to keep. 
Period with a positive numeric argument, as in `C-u 3 .', specifies the
number of newest versions to keep, overriding `dired-kept-versions'. 
A negative numeric argument overrides `kept-old-versions', using minus
the value of the argument to specify the number of oldest versions of
each file to keep.
