This is the file .../info/dir, which contains the topmost node of the
Info hierarchy.  The first time you invoke Info you start off
looking at that node, which is (dir)Top.

File: dir	Node: Top	This is the top of the INFO tree
  This (the Directory node) gives a menu of major topics.
  Typing "d" returns here, "q" exits, "?" lists all INFO commands, "h" gives
  a primer for first-timers, "mTexinfo<Return>" visits Texinfo topic, etc.

  Clicking middle on a highlighted word follows that crossreference.
  Clicking right anywhere brings up a menu of commands and references to
  follow.
