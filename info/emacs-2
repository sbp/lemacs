Keys and Commands
=================

   This manual is full of passages that tell you what particular keys
do.  But Emacs does not assign meanings to keys directly.  Instead,
Emacs assigns meanings to "functions", and then gives keys their
meanings by "binding" them to functions.

   A function is a Lisp object that can be executed as a program. 
Usually it is a Lisp symbol which has been given a function
definition; every symbol has a name, usually made of a few English
words separated by dashes, such as `next-line' or `forward-word'.  It
also has a "definition" which is a Lisp program.  Only some functions
can be the bindings of keys; these are functions whose definitions use
`interactive' to specify how to call them interactively.  Such
functions are called "commands", and their names are "command names". 
More information on this subject will appear in the GNU Emacs Lisp
Manual.

   The bindings between keys and functions are recorded in various
tables called "keymaps".  *Note Key Bindings:: for more information on
key sequences you can bind commands to.  *Note Keymaps:: for
information on creating keymaps.

   When we say  "`C-n' moves down vertically one line" we are glossing
over a distinction that is irrelevant in ordinary use but is vital in
understanding how to customize Emacs.  The function `next-line' is
programmed to move down vertically.  `C-n' has this effect because it
is bound to that function.  If you rebind `C-n' to the function
`forward-word' then `C-n' will move forward by words instead. 
Rebinding keys is a common method of customization.

   The rest of this manual usually ignores this subtlety to keep
things simple.  To give the customizer the information she needs, we
often state the name of the command which really does the work in
parentheses after mentioning the key that runs it.  For example, we
will say that "The command `C-n' (`next-line') moves point vertically
down," meaning that `next-line' is a command that moves vertically
down and `C-n' is a key that is standardly bound to it.

   While we are on the subject of information for customization only,
it's a good time to tell you about "variables".  Often the description
of a command will say, "To change this, set the variable
`mumble-foo'."  A variable is a name used to remember a value.  Most
of the variables documented in this manual exist just to facilitate
customization: some command or other part of Emacs uses the variable
and behaves differently depending on its setting.  Until you are
interested in customizing, you can ignore the information about
variables.  When you are ready to be interested, read the basic
information on variables, then the information on individual variables
will make sense.  *Note Variables::.

Lucid GNU Emacs Pull-down Menus
===============================

   If you are running Lucid GNU Emacs under X, a menu bar on top of the
Emacs screen provides access to pull-down menus of file, edit, and
help-related commands. The menus provide convenient shortcuts and an
easy interface for novice users.  They do not provide additions to the
functionality available via key commands; you can still invoke commands
from the keyboard as in previous versions of Emacs.

File
     Perform file and buffer-related operations, such as opening and
     closing files, saving and printing buffers, as well as exiting
     Emacs.

Edit
     Perform standard editing operations, such as cutting, copying,
     pasting and killing selected text.

Buffers
     Present a menu of buffers for selection as well as the option to
     display a buffer list.

Help
     Access to Emacs Info.

   There are two ways of selecting an item from a pulldown menu:

   * Select an item in the menu bar by moving the cursor over it and
     click the left mouse-button.  Then move the cursor over the item
     you want to choose and click left again.

   * Select an item in the menu bar by moving the cursor over it and
     click and hold the left mouse-button.  With the mouse-button
     depressed, move the cursor over the item you want, then release
     it to make your selection.

   If a command in the pull-down menu is not applicable in a given
situation, the command is disabled and its name appears faded.  You
cannot invoke items that are faded.  For example, most commands on the
Edit menu appear faded until you select text on which they are to
operate; after you select a block of text, edit commands are enabled. 
*Note Mouse Selection:: for information on using the mouse to select
text.  *Note Using X Selections:: for related information.

   There are `M-x' equivalents for each menu item.  To find the
equivalent for any left-button menu item, do the following:

  1. Type `C-h k' to get the `Describe Key' prompt.

  2. Select the menu item and click.

   Emacs displays the function associated with the menu item in a
separate window, usually together with some documentation.

* Menu:

* File Menu::           Items on the File menu.
* Edit Menu::           Items on the Edit menu.
* Buffers Menu::        Information about the Buffers menu
* Help Menu::           Items on the Help menu.
* Menu Customization::  Adding and removing menu items and related
                        operations.

The File Menu
.............

   The File menu bar item contains the items New Screen, Open File...,
Save Buffer, Save Buffer As..., Revert Buffer, Print Buffer, Delete
Screen, Kill Buffer and Exit Emacs on the pull-down menu.  If you
select a menu item, Emacs executes the equivalent command.

New Screen
     Creates a new Emacs screen, that is, a new X window running under
     the same Emacs process.  You can remove the screen using the
     Delete Screen menu item. When you remove the last screen, you
     exit Emacs and are prompted for confirmation.

Open File...
     Prompts you for a filename and loads that file into a new buffer. 
     Open File... is equivalent to the Emacs command `find-file' (`C-x
     C-f').

Save Buffer
     Writes and saves the current Emacs buffer as the latest version
     of the current visited file.  Save Buffer is equivalent to the
     Emacs command `save-buffer' (`C-x C-s').

Save Buffer As...
     Writes and saves the current Emacs buffer to the filename you
     specify.  Save Buffer As... is equivalent to the Emacs command
     `write-file' (`C-x C-w').

Revert Buffer
     Restores the last saved version of the file to the current
     buffer.  When you edit a buffer containing a text file, you must
     save the buffer before your changes become effective.  Use Revert
     Buffer if you do not want to keep the changes you have made in
     the buffer.  Revert Buffer is equivalent to the Emacs command
     `revert-file' (`M-x revert-buffer').

Print Buffer
     Prints a hardcopy of the current buffer.  Equivalent to the Emacs
     command `print-buffer' (`M-x print-buffer').

Delete Screen
     Allows you to close all but one of the screens created by New
     Screen.  If you created several Emacs screens belonging to the
     same Emacs process, you can close all but one of them.  When you
     attempt to close the last screen, Emacs informs you that you are
     attempting to delete the last screen.  You have to choose Exit
     Emacs for that.

Kill Buffer...
     Prompts you for the name of a buffer to kill. The default is the
     name of the currently selected buffer. Kill Buffer is equivalent
     to the Emacs command `kill-buffer' (`C-x k').

Exit Emacs
     Shuts down (kills) the Emacs process.  Equivalent to the Emacs
     command `save-buffers-kill-emacs' (`C-x C-c').  Before killing the
     Emacs process, the system asks which unsaved buffers to save by
     going through the list of all buffers in that Emacs process.

The Edit Menu
.............

   The Edit pull-down menu contains the Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste and
Clear menu items.  When you select a menu item, Emacs executes the
equivalent command.  Most commands on the Edit menu work on a block of
text, the X selection.  They appear faded until you select a block of
text (activate a region) with the mouse.  *Note Using X Selections::,
*note Killing::., and *note Yanking::. for more information.

   Note: By default, you can use the Edit menu items on the region
between point an the mark as well as regions selected with the mouse.
To change this behavior, set the variable `zmacs-regions' to `t'.
*Note Active Regions:: for more information.

Undo
     Undoes the previous command.  Undo is equivalent to the Emacs
     command `undo' (`C-x u').

Cut
     Removes the selected text block from the current buffer, makes it
     the X clipboard selection, and places it in the kill ring. 
     Before executing this command, you have to select a region using
     Emacs region selection commands or with the mouse.

Copy
     Makes a selected text block the X clipboard selection, and places
     it in the kill ring. By default, you can select text using on of
     the Emacs region selection commands or select a text region with
     the mouse.

Paste
     Inserts the current value of the X clipboard selection in the
     current buffer.  Note that this is not necessarily the same as
     the Emacs `yank' command because the Emacs kill ring and the X
     clipboard selection are by default not the same thing. You can
     paste in text you place in the clipboard using Copy or Cut.  You
     can also use Paste to insert text that was pasted into the
     clipboard from other applications.

Clear
     Removes the selected text block from the current buffer but does
     not place it in the kill ring or the X clipboard selection.

The Buffers Menu
................

   The Buffers menu provides a selection of up to ten buffers and the
item List All Buffers, which provides a Buffer List. *Note List
Buffers:: for more information.


File: emacs,  Node: Help Menu,  Prev: Buffers Menu,  Up: Pull-down Menus

The Help Menu
.............

   The Help Menu gives you access to Emacs Info and provides a menu
equivalents for each of the choices you have when using `C-h'.  *Note
Help:: for more information.

   The Help menu also gives access to UNIX online manual pages via the
UNIX Manual Page option.

Entering and Exiting Emacs
**************************

   The usual way to invoke Emacs is to type `emacs RET' at the shell. 
To invoke Lucid GNU Emacs, type `lemacs RET'.  Emacs clears the screen
and then displays an initial advisory message and copyright notice. 
You can begin typing Emacs commands immediately afterward.

   Some operating systems insist on discarding all type-ahead when
Emacs starts up; they give Emacs no way to prevent this.  Therefore,
it is wise to wait until Emacs clears the screen before typing the
first editing command.

   Before Emacs reads the first command, you have not had a chance to
give a command to specify a file to edit.  Since Emacs must always
have a current buffer for editing, it presents a buffer, by default, a
buffer named `*scratch*'.  The buffer is in Lisp Interaction mode; you
can use it to type Lisp expressions and evaluate them, or you can
ignore that capability and simply doodle.  You can specify a different
major mode for this buffer by setting the variable
`initial-major-mode' in your init file.  *Note Init File::.

   It is possible to give Emacs arguments in the shell command line to
specify files to visit, Lisp files to load, and functions to call.


File: emacs,  Node: Exiting,  Next: Command Switches,  Prev: Entering Emacs,  Up: Top

Exiting Emacs
=============

   There are two commands for exiting Emacs because there are two kinds
of exiting: "suspending" Emacs and "killing" Emacs.  "Suspending"
means stopping Emacs temporarily and returning control to its superior
(usually the shell), allowing you to resume editing later in the same
Emacs job, with the same files, same kill ring, same undo history, and
so on.  This is the usual way to exit.  "Killing" Emacs means
destroying the Emacs job.  You can run Emacs again later, but you will
get a fresh Emacs; there is no way to resume the same editing session
after it has been killed.

`C-z'
     Suspend Emacs (`suspend-emacs').  If used under the X window
     system, shrink the X window containing the Emacs screen to an
     icon.  (see below)

`C-x C-c'
     Kill Emacs (`save-buffers-kill-emacs').

   If you use Lucid GNU Emacs under the X window system, `C-z' shrinks
the X window containing the Emacs screen to an icon.  The Emacs process
is stopped temporarily, and control is returned to the window manager. 
If more than one screen is associated with the Emacs process, only the
screen from which you used `C-z' is retained.  The X windows
containing the other Emacs screens are closed.

   To activate the "suspended" Emacs, use the appropriate window
manager mouse gestures.  Usually left-clicking on the icon reactivates
and reopens the X window containing the Emacs screen, but the window
manager you use determines what exactly happens.  To actually kill the
Emacs process, use `C-x C-c' or the Exit Emacs item on the File menu.

   On systems that do not permit programs to be suspended, `C-z' runs
an inferior shell that communicates directly with the terminal, and
Emacs waits until you exit the subshell.  On these systems, the only
way to return to the shell from which Emacs was started (to log out,
for example) is to kill Emacs.  `C-d' or `exit' are typical commands
to exit a subshell.

   To kill Emacs, type `C-x C-c' (`save-buffers-kill-emacs').  A
two-character key is used for this to make it harder to type.  In Lucid
GNU Emacs, selecting the Exit Emacs option of the File menu is an
alternate way of issuing the command.

   Unless a numeric argument is used, this command first offers to
save any modified buffers.  If you do not save all buffers, you are
asked for reconfirmation with `yes' before killing Emacs, since any
changes not saved will be lost.  If any subprocesses are still
running, `C-x C-c' asks you to confirm killing them, since killing
Emacs kills the subprocesses simultaneously.

   In most programs running on Unix, certain characters may instantly
suspend or kill the program.  (In Berkeley Unix these characters are
normally `C-z' and `C-c'.)  This Unix feature is turned off while you
are in Emacs. The meanings of `C-z' and `C-x C-c' as keys in Emacs
were inspired by the standard Berkeley Unix meanings of `C-z' and
`C-c', but that is their only relationship with Unix.  You could
customize these keys to do anything (*note Keymaps::.).

Command Line Switches and Arguments
===================================

   GNU Emacs supports command line arguments you can use to request
various actions when invoking Emacs.  The commands are for
compatibility with other editors and for sophisticated activities.  If
you are using Lucid GNU Emacs under the X window system, you can also
use a number of standard Xt command line arguments. Command line
arguments are not usually needed for editing with Emacs; new users can
skip this section.

   Many editors are designed to be started afresh each time you want to
edit.  You start the editor to edit one file; then exit the editor. 
The next time you want to edit either another file or the same one, you
start the editor again.  Under these circumstances, it makes sense to
use a command line argument to say which file to edit.

   The recommended way to use GNU Emacs is to start it only once, just
after you log in, and do all your editing in the same Emacs process. 
Each time you want to edit a file, you visit it using the existing
Emacs.  Emacs creates a new buffer for each file and (unless you kill
some of the buffers), Emacs eventually has many files in it ready for
editing.  Usually you do not kill the Emacs process until you are about
to log out.  Since you usually read files by typing commands to Emacs,
command line arguments for specifying a file Emacs is started are
seldom needed.

   Emacs accepts command-line arguments that specify files to visit,
functions to call, and other activities and operating modes.  If you
are running Lucid GNU Emacs under the X window system, a number of
standard Xt command line arguments are available as well.

   The following sections list:

  1. Command line arguments that you can always use.

  2. Command line arguments that have to appear at the beginning of the
     argument list

  3. Command line arguments that are only relevant if you are running
     Lucid GNU Emacs under X

   Command line arguments are processed in the order they appear on the
command line; however, certain arguments (the ones in the second
table) must be at the front of the list if they are used.

   Here are the arguments allowed:

`FILE'
     Visit FILE using `find-file'.  *Note Visiting::.

`+LINENUM FILE'
     Visit FILE using `find-file', then go to line number LINENUM in
     it.

`-l FILE'
`-load FILE'
     Load a file FILE of Lisp code with the function `load'.  *Note
     Lisp Libraries::.

`-f FUNCTION'
`-funcall FUNCTION'
     Call Lisp function FUNCTION with no arguments.

`-i FILE'
`-insert FILE'
     Insert the contents of FILE into the current buffer.  This is like
     what `M-x insert-buffer' does; *Note Misc File Ops::.

`-kill'
     Exit from Emacs without asking for confirmation.

   The following arguments are recognized only at the beginning of the
command line.  If more than one of them appears, they must appear in
the order in which they appear in this table.

`-t FILE'
     Use FILE instead of the terminal for input and output. (This
     option is currently not valid in Lucid GNU Emacs)

`-batch'
     Run Emacs in "batch mode", which means that the text being edited
     is not displayed and the standard Unix interrupt characters such
     as `C-z' and `C-c' continue to have their normal effect.  Emacs in
     batch mode outputs to `stdout' only what would normally be printed
     in the echo area under program control.

     Batch mode is used for running programs written in Emacs Lisp
     from shell scripts, makefiles, and so on.  Normally the `-l'
     switch or `-f' switch will be used as well, to invoke a Lisp
     program to do the batch processing.

     `-batch' implies `-q' (do not load an init file).  It also causes
     Emacs to kill itself after all command switches have been
     processed.  In addition, auto-saving is not done except in
     buffers for which it has been explicitly requested.

`-q'
`-no-init-file'
     Do not load your Emacs init file `~/.emacs'.

`-u USER'
`-user USER'
     Load USER's Emacs init file `~USER/.emacs' instead of your own.

   Note that the init file can get access to the command line argument
values as the elements of a list in the variable `command-line-args'. 
(The arguments in the second table above will already have been
processed and will not be in the list.)  The init file can override
the normal processing of the other arguments by setting this variable.

   One way to use command switches is to visit many files
automatically:

     emacs *.c

passes each `.c' file as a separate argument to Emacs, so that Emacs
visits each file (*note Visiting::.).

   Here is an advanced example that assumes you have a Lisp program
file called `hack-c-program.el' which, when loaded, performs some
useful operation on the current buffer, expected to be a C program.

     emacs -batch foo.c -l hack-c-program -f save-buffer -kill > log

Here Emacs is told to visit `foo.c', load `hack-c-program.el' (which
makes changes in the visited file), save `foo.c' (note that
`save-buffer' is the function that `C-x C-s' is bound to), and then
exit to the shell from which the command was executed.  `-batch'
guarantees there will be no problem redirecting output to `log',
because Emacs will not assume that it has a display terminal to work
with.

   If you are running Lucid GNU Emacs under X, a number of options are
available to control color, border, and window title and icon name:

`-T TITLE'
`-wn TITLE'
     Use TITLE as the window title. This sets the SCREEN-TITLE-FORMAT
     variable.

`-in TITLE'
`-iconname TITLE'
     Use TITLE as the icon name. This sets the
     SCREEN-ICON-TITLE-FORMAT variable.

`-mc COLOR'
     Use COLOR as the mouse color.

`-cr COLOR'
     Use COLOR as the text-cursor foreground color.

   In addition, Lucid GNU Emacs allows you to use a number of standard
XT command line arguments.

`-bg COLOR'
`-background COLOR'
     Use COLOR as the background color.

`-bd COLOR'
`-bordercolor COLOR'
     Use COLOR as the border color.

`-bw WIDTH'
`-borderwidth WIDTH'
     Use WIDTH as the border width.

`-d DISPLAY'
`-display DISPLAY'
`-d DISPLAY'
     When running under the X window system, create the window
     containing the Emacs screen on the display named DISPLAY.

`-fg COLOR'
`-foreground COLOR'
     Use COLOR as the foreground color.

`-fn NAME'
`-font NAME'
     Use NAME as the font.

`-g SPEC'
`-geom SPEC'
`-geometry SPEC'
     Use the geometry specified by SPEC.

`- iconic'
     Start up iconified.

`-r'
`-reverse'
     Bring up Emacs in reverse video

`-name'
     Use the resource manager specified by NAME.

`-xrm'
     Read something into the resource database for this invocation of
     Emacs.  text t

`-title TITLE'
     Same as `-wn', sets the window title using WINDOW-TITLE-FORMAT

Basic Editing Commands
**********************

   We now give the basics of how to enter text, make corrections, and
save the text in a file.  If this material is new to you, you might
learn it more easily by running the Emacs learn-by-doing tutorial.  To
do this, type `Control-h t' (`help-with-tutorial').

Inserting Text
==============

   To insert printing characters into the text you are editing, just
type them.  This inserts the characters into the buffer at the cursor
(that is, at "point"; *note Point::.).  The cursor moves forward.  Any
characters after the cursor move forward too.  If the text in the
buffer is `FOOBAR', with the cursor before the `B' and you type `XX',
the result is `FOOXXBAR', with the cursor still before the `B'.

   To "delete" text you have just inserted, use DEL.  DEL deletes the
character BEFORE the cursor (not the one that the cursor is on top of
or under; that is the character AFTER the cursor).  The cursor and all
characters after it move backwards.  Therefore, if you type a printing
character and then type DEL, they cancel out.

   To end a line and start typing a new one, type RET.  This inserts a
newline character in the buffer.  If point is in the middle of a line,
RET splits the line.  Typing DEL when the cursor is at the beginning
of a line rubs out the newline before the line, thus joining the line
with the preceding line.

   Emacs automatically splits lines when they become too long, if you
turn on a special mode called "Auto Fill" mode.  *Note Filling::, for
information on using Auto Fill mode.

   Customization information: DEL, in most modes, runs the command
`delete-backward-char'; RET runs the command `newline', and
self-inserting printing characters run the command `self-insert',
which inserts whatever character was typed to invoke it.  Some major
modes rebind DEL to other commands.

   Direct insertion works for printing characters and SPC, but other
characters act as editing commands and do not insert themselves.  If
you need to insert a control character or a character whose code is
above 200 octal, you must "quote" it by typing the character
`control-q' (`quoted-insert') first.  There are two ways to use `C-q':

   * `Control-q' followed by any non-graphic character (even `C-g')
     inserts that character.

   * `Control-q' followed by three octal digits inserts the character
     with the specified character code.

A numeric argument to `C-q' specifies how many copies of the quoted
character should be inserted (*note Arguments::.).

   If you prefer to have text characters replace (overwrite) existing
text instead of moving it to the right, you can enable Overwrite mode,
a minor mode.  *Note Minor Modes::.

Changing the Location of Point
==============================

   To do more than insert characters, you have to know how to move
point (*note Point::.).  Here are a few of the available commands.

`C-a'
     Move to the beginning of the line (`beginning-of-line').

`C-e'
     Move to the end of the line (`end-of-line').

`C-f'
     Move forward one character (`forward-char').

`C-b'
     Move backward one character (`backward-char').

`M-f'
     Move forward one word (`forward-word').

`M-b'
     Move backward one word (`backward-word').

`C-n'
     Move down one line, vertically (`next-line').  This command
     attempts to keep the horizontal position unchanged, so if you
     start in the middle of one line, you end in the middle of the
     next.  When on the last line of text, `C-n' creates a new line
     and moves onto it.

`C-p'
     Move up one line, vertically (`previous-line').

`C-l'
     Clear the screen and reprint everything (`recenter').  Text moves
     on the screen to bring point to the center of the window.

`M-r'
     Move point to left margin on the line halfway down the screen or
     window (`move-to-window-line').  Text does not move on the
     screen.  A numeric argument says how many screen lines down from
     the top of the window (zero for the top).  A negative argument
     counts from the bottom (-1 for the bottom).

`C-t'
     Transpose two characters, the ones before and after the cursor 
     (`transpose-chars').

`M-<'
     Move to the top of the buffer (`beginning-of-buffer').  With
     numeric argument N, move to N/10 of the way from the top.  *Note
     Arguments::, for more information on numeric arguments.

`M->'
     Move to the end of the buffer (`end-of-buffer').

`M-x goto-char'
     Read a number N and move the cursor to character number N. 
     Position 1 is the beginning of the buffer.

`M-x goto-line'
     Read a number N and move cursor to line number N.  Line 1 is the
     beginning of the buffer.

`C-x C-n'
     Use the current column of point as the "semi-permanent goal
     column" for `C-n' and `C-p' (`set-goal-column').  Henceforth,
     those commands always move to this column in each line moved
     into, or as close as possible given the contents of the line. 
     This goal column remains in effect until canceled.

`C-u C-x C-n'
     Cancel the goal column.  Henceforth, `C-n' and `C-p' once again
     try to avoid changing the horizontal position, as usual.

   If you set the variable `track-eol' to a non-`nil' value, `C-n' and
`C-p' move to the end of the line when at the end of the starting
line.  By default, `track-eol' is `nil'.

Erasing Text
============

`DEL'
     Delete the character before the cursor (`delete-backward-char').

`C-d'
     Delete the character after the cursor (`delete-char').

`C-k'
     Kill to the end of the line (`kill-line').

`M-d'
     Kill forward to the end of the next word (`kill-word').

`M-DEL'
     Kill back to the beginning of the previous word
     (`backward-kill-word').

   In contrast to the DEL key, which deletes the character before the
cursor, `Control-d' deletes the character after the cursor, causing
the rest of the text on the line to shift left.  If `Control-d' is
typed at the end of a line, that line and the next line are joined.

   To erase a larger amount of text, use `Control-k', which kills a
line at a time.  If you use `C-k' at the beginning or in the middle of
a line, it kills all the text up to the end of the line.  If you use
`C-k' at the end of a line, it joins that line and the next line.

   *Note Killing::, for more flexible ways of killing text.

Files
=====

   The commands above are sufficient for creating and altering text in
an Emacs buffer.  More advanced Emacs commands just make things
easier.  But to keep any text permanently you must put it in a "file".
 Files are named units of text which are stored by the operating
system and which you can retrieve by name.  To look at or use the
contents of a file in any way, including editing the file with Emacs,
you must specify the file name.

   Consider a file named `/usr/rms/foo.c'.  To begin editing this file
from Emacs, type

     C-x C-f /usr/rms/foo.c RET

The file name is given as an "argument" to the command `C-x C-f'
(`find-file').  The command uses the "minibuffer" to read the
argument.  You have to type RET to terminate the argument (*note
Minibuffer::.).

   You can also use the Open File... menu item from the File menu, then
type the name of the file to the prompt.

   Emacs obeys the command by "visiting" the file: it creates a
buffer, copies the contents of the file into the buffer, and then
displays the buffer for you to edit.  You can make changes in the
buffer, and then "save" the file by typing `C-x C-s' (`save-buffer')
or choosing Save Buffer from the File menu.  This makes the changes
permanent by copying the altered contents of the buffer back into the
file `/usr/rms/foo.c'.  Until then, the changes are only inside your
Emacs buffer, and the file `foo.c' is not changed.

   To create a file, visit the file with `C-x C-f' as if it already
existed or choose Open File from the File menu and provide the name
for the new file in the minibuffer.  Emacs will create an empty buffer
in which you can insert the text you want to put in the file.  When
you save the buffer with `C-x C-s', or by choosing Save Buffer from
the File menu, the file is created.

Help
====

   If you forget what a key does, you can use the Help character,
`C-h' to find out: Type `C-h k' followed by the key you want to know
about.  For example, `C-h k C-n' tells you what `C-n' does.  `C-h' is
a prefix key; `C-h k' is just one of its subcommands (the command
`describe-key').  The other subcommands of `C-h' provide different
kinds of help.  Type `C-h' three times to get a description of all the
help facilities.  *Note Help::.

* Menu:

* Blank Lines::        Commands to make                         or delete blank lines.
* Continuation Lines:: Lines too wide for the screen.
* Position Info::      What page, line, row, or column is point on?

Blank Lines
===========

   Here are special commands and techniques for entering and removing
blank lines.

`C-o'
     Insert one or more blank lines after the cursor (`open-line').

`C-x C-o'
     Delete all but one of many consecutive blank lines
     (`delete-blank-lines').

   When you want to insert a new line of text before an existing line,
you just type the new line of text, followed by RET.  If you prefer to
first create a blank line and then insert the desired text, use the
key `C-o' (`open-line'), which inserts a newline after point but
leaves point in front of the newline.  Then type the text into the new
line.  `C-o F O O' has the same effect as `F O O RET', except for the
final location of point.

   To create several blank lines, type `C-o' several times, or give
`C-o' an argument indicating how many blank lines to create.  *Note
Arguments::, for more information.

   If you have many blank lines in a row and want to get rid of them,
use `C-x C-o' (`delete-blank-lines').  If point is on a blank line
which is adjacent to at least one other blank line, `C-x C-o' deletes
all but one of the blank lines.  If point is on a blank line with no
other adjacent blank line, the sole blank line is deleted.  If point
is on a non-blank line, `C-x C-o' deletes any blank lines following
that non-blank line.


File: emacs,  Node: Continuation Lines,  Next: Position Info,  Prev: Blank Lines,  Up: Basic

Continuation Lines
==================

   If you add too many characters to one line without breaking with a
RET, the line grows to occupy two (or more) screen lines, with a
curved arrow at the extreme right margin of all but the last line.  The
curved arrow indicates that the following screen line is not really a
distinct line in the text, but just the "continuation" of a line too
long to fit the screen.  You can use Auto Fill mode, (*note
Filling::.), to have Emacs insert newlines automatically when a line
gets too long.

   Instead of continuation, long lines can be displayed by
"truncation".  This means that all the characters that do not fit in
the width of the screen or window do not appear at all.  They remain
in the buffer, temporarily invisible.  Three diagonal dots in the last
column (instead of the curved arrow inform you that truncation is in
effect.

   To turn off continuation for a particular buffer set the variable
`truncate-lines' to non-`nil' in that buffer.  Truncation instead of
continuation also happens whenever horizontal scrolling is in use, and
optionally whenever side-by-side windows are in use (*note
Windows::.).  Altering the value of `truncate-lines' makes it local to
the current buffer; until that time, the default value is in effect. 
The default is initially `nil'.  *Note Locals::.

Cursor Position Information
===========================

   If you are accustomed to other display editors, you may be surprised
that Emacs does not always display the page number or line number of
point in the mode line.  In Emacs, this information is only rarely
needed, and a number of commands are available to compute and print it. 
Since text is stored in a way that makes it difficult to compute the
information, it is not displayed all the time.

`M-x what-page'
     Print page number of point, and line number within page.

`M-x what-line'
     Print line number of point in the buffer.

`M-='
     Print number of lines in the current region
     (`count-lines-region').

`C-x ='
     Print character code of character after point, character position
     of point, and column of point (`what-cursor-position').

   There are several commands for printing line numbers:

   * `M-x what-line' counts lines from the beginning of the file and
     prints the line number point is on.  The first line of the file
     is line number 1.  You can use these numbers as arguments to `M-x
     goto-line'.

   * `M-x what-page' counts pages from the beginning of the file, and
     counts lines within the page, printing both of them.  *Note
     Pages::, for the command `C-x l' which counts the lines in the
     current page.

   * `M-=' (`count-lines-region'), prints the number of lines in the
     region (*note Mark::.).

   The command `C-x =' (`what-cursor-position') provides information
about point and about the column the cursor is in.  It prints a line
in the echo area that looks like this:

     Char: x (0170)  point=65986 of 563027(12%)  x=44

(In fact, this is the output produced when point is before the `x=44'
in the example.)

   The two values after `Char:' describe the character following point,
first by showing it and second by giving its octal character code.

   `point=' is followed by the position of point expressed as a
character count.  The front of the buffer counts as position 1, one
character later as 2, and so on.  The next, larger number is the total
number of characters in the buffer.  Afterward in parentheses comes
the position expressed as a percentage of the total size.

   `x=' is followed by the horizontal position of point, in columns
from the left edge of the window.

   If the buffer has been narrowed, making some of the text at the
beginning and the end temporarily invisible, `C-x =' prints additional
text describing the current visible range.  For example, it might say

     Char: x (0170)  point=65986 of 563025(12%) <65102 - 68533>  x=44

where the two extra numbers give the smallest and largest character
position that point is allowed to assume.  The characters between
those two positions are the visible ones.  *Note Narrowing::.

   If point is at the end of the buffer (or the end of the visible
part), `C-x =' omits any description of the character after point. 
The output looks like

     point=563026 of 563025(100%)  x=0


File: emacs,  Node: Arguments,  Prev: Position Info,  Up: Basic

Numeric Arguments
=================

   Any Emacs command can be given a "numeric argument".  Some commands
interpret the argument as a repetition count.  For example, giving an
argument of ten to the key `C-f' (the command `forward-char', move
forward one character) moves forward ten characters.  With these
commands, no argument is equivalent to an argument of one.  Negative
arguments are allowed.  Often they tell a command to move or act
backwards.

   If your keyboard has a META key, the easiest way to specify a
numeric argument is to type digits and/or a minus sign while holding
down the the META key.  For example,

     M-5 C-n

moves down five lines.  The characters `Meta-1', `Meta-2', and so on,
as well as `Meta--', do this because they are keys bound to commands
(`digit-argument' and `negative-argument') that are defined to
contribute to an argument for the next command.

   Another way of specifying an argument is to use the `C-u'
(`universal-argument') command followed by the digits of the argument. 
With `C-u', you can type the argument digits without holding down
shift keys.  To type a negative argument, start with a minus sign. 
Just a minus sign normally means -1.  `C-u' works on all terminals.

   `C-u' followed by a character which is neither a digit nor a minus
sign has the special meaning of "multiply by four".  It multiplies the
argument for the next command by four.  `C-u' twice multiplies it by
sixteen.  Thus, `C-u C-u C-f' moves forward sixteen characters.  This
is a good way to move forward "fast", since it moves about 1/5 of a
line in the usual size screen.  Other useful combinations are `C-u
C-n', `C-u C-u C-n' (move down a good fraction of a screen), `C-u C-u
C-o' (make "a lot" of blank lines), and `C-u C-k' (kill four lines).

   Some commands care only about whether there is an argument, and not
about its value.  For example, the command `M-q' (`fill-paragraph')
with no argument fills text; with an argument, it justifies the text
as well.  (*Note Filling::, for more information on `M-q'.)  Just
`C-u' is a handy way of providing an argument for such commands.

   Some commands use the value of the argument as a repeat count, but
do something peculiar when there is no argument.  For example, the
command `C-k' (`kill-line') with argument N kills N lines, including
their terminating newlines.  But `C-k' with no argument is special: it
kills the text up to the next newline, or, if point is right at the
end of the line, it kills the newline itself.  Thus, two `C-k'
commands with no arguments can kill a non-blank line, just like `C-k'
with an argument of one.  (*Note Killing::, for more information on
`C-k'.)

   A few commands treat a plain `C-u' differently from an ordinary
argument.  A few others may treat an argument of just a minus sign
differently from an argument of -1.  These unusual cases will be
described when they come up; they are always for reasons of convenience
of use of the individual command.

Undoing Changes
***************

   Emacs allows you to undo all changes you make to the text of a
buffer, up to a certain amount of change (8000 characters).  Each
buffer records changes individually, and the undo command always
applies to the current buffer.  Usually each editing command makes a
separate entry in the undo records, but some commands such as
`query-replace' make many entries, and very simple commands such as
self-inserting characters are often grouped to make undoing less
tedious.

`C-x u'
     Undo one batch of changes (usually, one command worth) (`undo').

`C-_'
     The same.

   The command `C-x u' or `C-_' allows you to undo changes.  The first
time you give this command, it undoes the last change.  Point moves to
the text affected by the undo, so you can see what was undone.

   Consecutive repetitions of the `C-_' or `C-x u' commands undo
earlier and earlier changes, back to the limit of what has been
recorded.  If all recorded changes have already been undone, the undo
command prints an error message and does nothing.

   Any command other than an undo command breaks the sequence of undo
commands.  Starting at this moment, the previous undo commands are
considered ordinary changes that can themselves be undone.  Thus, you
can redo changes you have undone by typing `C-f' or any other command
that have no important effect, and then using more undo commands.

   If you notice that a buffer has been modified accidentally, the
easiest way to recover is to type `C-_' repeatedly until the stars
disappear from the front of the mode line.  When that happens, all the
modifications you made have been cancelled.  If you do not remember
whether you changed the buffer deliberately, type `C-_' once. When you
see Emacs undo the last change you made, you probably remember why you
made it.  If the change was an accident, leave it undone.  If it was
deliberate, redo the change as described in the preceding paragraph.

   Whenever an undo command makes the stars disappear from the mode
line, the buffer contents is the same as it was when the file was last
read in or saved.

   Not all buffers record undo information.  Buffers whose names start
with spaces don't; these buffers are used internally by Emacs and its
extensions to hold text that users don't normally look at or edit. 
Minibuffers, help buffers and documentation buffers also don't record
undo information.

   Emacs can remember at most 8000 or so characters of deleted or
modified text in any one buffer for reinsertion by the undo command. 
There is also a limit on the number of individual insert, delete or
change actions that Emacs can remembered.

   There are two keys to run the `undo' command, `C-x u' and `C-_',
because on some keyboards, it is not obvious how to type `C-_'. `C-x
u' is an alternative you can type in the same fashion on any terminal.

The Minibuffer
**************

   Emacs commands use the "minibuffer" to read arguments more
complicated than a single number.  Minibuffer arguments can be file
names, buffer names, Lisp function names, Emacs command names, Lisp
expressions, and many other things, depending on the command reading
the argument.  To edit the argument in the minibuffer, you can use
Emacs editing commands.

   When the minibuffer is in use, it appears in the echo area, and the
cursor moves there.  The beginning of the minibuffer line displays a
"prompt" indicating what kind of input you should supply and how it
will be used.  The prompt is often derived from the name of the command
the argument is for.  The prompt normally ends with a colon.

   Sometimes a "default argument" appears in parentheses after the
colon; it too is part of the prompt.  The default is used as the
argument value if you enter an empty argument (e.g., just type RET). 
For example, commands that read buffer names always show a default,
which is the name of the buffer that will be used if you type just RET.

   The simplest way to give a minibuffer argument is to type the text
you want, terminated by RET to exit the minibuffer.  To get out of the
minibuffer and cancel the command that it was for, type `C-g'.

   Since the minibuffer uses the screen space of the echo area, it can
conflict with other ways Emacs customarily uses the echo area.  Here
is how Emacs handles such conflicts:

   * If a command gets an error while you are in the minibuffer, this
     does not cancel the minibuffer.  However, the echo area is needed
     for the error message and therefore the minibuffer itself is
     hidden for a while.  It comes back after a few seconds, or as
     soon as you type anything.

   * If you use a command in the minibuffer whose purpose is to print a
     message in the echo area (for example `C-x =') the message is
     displayed normally, and the minibuffer is hidden for a while.  It
     comes back after a few seconds, or as soon as you type anything.

   * Echoing of keystrokes does not take place while the minibuffer is
     in use.

* Menu:

* File: Minibuffer File.  Entering file names with the minibuffer.
* Edit: Minibuffer Edit.  How to edit in the minibuffer.
* Completion::		  An abbreviation facility for minibuffer input.
* Repetition::		  Re-executing commands that used the minibuffer.

Minibuffers for File Names
==========================

   Sometimes the minibuffer starts out with text in it.  For example,
when you are supposed to give a file name, the minibuffer starts out
containing the "default directory", which ends with a slash.  This
informs you in which directory the file will be found if you do not
specify one.  For example, the minibuffer might start out with

     Find File: /u2/emacs/src/

where `Find File: ' is the prompt.  Typing `buffer.c' specifies the
file 
`/u2/emacs/src/buffer.c'.  To find files in nearby directories, use
`..'; thus, if you type `../lisp/simple.el', the file that you visit
will be the one named 
`/u2/emacs/lisp/simple.el'.  Alternatively, you can use  `M-DEL' to
kill directory names you don't want (*note Words::.).

   You can also type an absolute file name, one starting with a slash
or a tilde, ignoring the default directory.  For example, to find the
file `/etc/termcap', just type the name, giving

     Find File: /u2/emacs/src//etc/termcap

Two slashes in a row are not normally meaningful in Unix file names,
but they are allowed in GNU Emacs.  They mean, "ignore everything
before the second slash in the pair."  Thus, `/u2/emacs/src/' is
ignored, and you get the file `/etc/termcap'.

   If you set `insert-default-directory' to `nil', the default
directory is not inserted in the minibuffer.  This way, the minibuffer
starts out empty.  But the name you type, if relative, is still
interpreted with respect to the same default directory.


File: emacs,  Node: Minibuffer Edit,  Next: Completion,  Prev: Minibuffer File,  Up: Minibuffer

Editing in the Minibuffer
=========================

   The minibuffer is an Emacs buffer (albeit a peculiar one), and the
usual Emacs commands are available for editing the text of an argument
you are entering.

   Since RET in the minibuffer is defined to exit the minibuffer, you
must use `C-o' or `C-q LFD' to insert a newline into the minibuffer.
(Recall that a newline is really the LFD character.)

   The minibuffer has its own window which always has space on the
screen but acts as if it were not there when the minibuffer is not in
use.  When the minibuffer is in use. The minibuffer window is just
like the others; you can switch to another window with `C-x o', edit
text in other windows and perhaps even visit more files, before
returning to the minibuffer to submit the argument.  You can kill text
in another window, return to the minibuffer window, and then yank the
text to use it in the argument.  *Note Windows::.

   There are, however, some restrictions on the use of the minibuffer
window.  You cannot switch buffers in it--the minibuffer and its
window are permanently attached.  You also cannot split or kill the
minibuffer window, but you can make it taller with `C-x ^'.

   If you are in the minibuffer and issue a command that displays help
text in another window, that window will be scrolled if you type
`C-M-v' while in the minibuffer until you exit the minibuffer.  This
feature is helpful if a completing minibuffer gives you a long list of
possible completions.

   If the variable `minibuffer-confirm-incomplete' is `true', you are
asked for confirmation if there is no known completion for the text
you typed. For example, if you attempted to visit a non-existent file,
the minibuffer might read:

             Find File:chocolate_bar.c [no completions, confirm]

   If you press `Return' again, that confirms the filename. Otherwise,
you can continue editing it.

   Emacs supports recursive use of the minibuffer.  However, it is
easy to do this by accident (because of autorepeating keyboards, for
example) and get confused.  Therefore, most Emacs commands that use the
minibuffer refuse to operate if the minibuffer window is selected.  If
the minibuffer is active but you have switched to a different window,
recursive use of the minibuffer is allowed--if you know enough to try
to do this, you probably will not get confused.

   If you set the variable `enable-recursive-minibuffers' to be
non-`nil', recursive use of the minibuffer is always allowed.
