Introducing ange-ftp.
*********************

   Ange-ftp is a system for transparent file-transfer between remote
UNIX, VMS, CMS or MTS hosts using FTP. This means that you can edit,
copy and otherwise manipulate files on any machine you have access to
from within GNU Emacs as if it were a local file. Ange-ftp works by
introducing an extended filename syntax, and overloading functions such
as `insert-file-contents' so that accessing a remote file causes
appropriate commands to be sent to an FTP process. Ange-ftp works with
Dired (and in particular Sebastian Kremer's Tree Dired) to facilitate
directory browsing and multiple file transfer from remote hosts.

   The author of ange-ftp is Andy (Ange) Norman
(`ange@hplb.hpl.hp.com').  Many people have sent in enhancements, and
Ange has been kept quite busy testing them and incorporating them into
ange-ftp. Current members of the Ange-Ftp Hall of Fame include:

   * Many thanks to Roland McGrath for improving the filename syntax
     handling, for suggesting many enhancements and for numerous
     cleanups to the code.

   * Thanks to Jamie Zawinski for bugfixes and for ideas such as
     gateways.

   * Thanks to Ken Laprade for improved `.netrc' parsing and password
     reading, and Dired/shell autoloading.

   * Thanks to Sebastian Kremer for tree dired support and for many
     ideas and bugfixes.

   * Thanks to Joe Wells for bugfixes, non-UNIX system support, VOS
     support, and hostname completion.

   * Thanks to Nakagawa Takayuki for many good ideas,
     filename-completion, help with file-name expansion, efficiency
     worries, stylistic concerns and many bugfixes.

   * Thanks to Sandy Rutherford who re-wrote most of ange-ftp to
     support VMS, MTS, CMS and UNIX-dls.  Sandy also added
     dired-support for non-UNIX OS and auto-recognition of the host
     type.

   * Also, thanks to Keith Waclena, Mark D. Baushke, Terence Kelleher,
     Ping Zhou, Edward Vielmetti, Jack Repenning, Mike Balenger, Todd
     Kaufmann, Kjetil Svarstad, Tom Wurgler, Linus Tolke, Niko Makila,
     Carl Edman, Bill Trost, Dave Brennan, Dan Jacobson, Andy Scott,
     Steve Anderson, Sanjay Mathur, the folks on the ange-ftp-lovers
     mailing list and many others whose names have been forgotten who
     have helped to debug and fix problems with `ange-ftp.el'.

   Finally, this info file was written by Dave Smith
(`dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au'), although large chunks of it

(such as most of this node :-)

are plagiarised straight out of the extensive comments section of
`ange-ftp.el'.

Installing ange-ftp
*******************

   If you don't already have a copy of ange-ftp, or you want a later
version, ange-ftp is pretty easy to get hold of. FTP is the probably the
simplest method, but other options such as mail are available.

   Once you have the Emacs-Lisp source, there are a few customisations
you might need to make. The ideal configuration is to have the FTP
process running on the same machine as you are running Emacs on, but
this is not always possible since some machines cannot access hosts
outside the local network. In this case, the FTP process needs to be
run on a machine which *does* have access to the local world -- this is
called the *gateway host*. Ange-ftp has facilities to make use of a
gateway host when accessing remote hosts.

* Obtaining source code::	Where to find the ange-ftp source.
* Installing source::		Where to put it, how to load it.
* Using a gateway::		For when your local machine has limited access.
* Other options::		More user variables to twiddle.

How to get the ange-ftp source code
===================================

   The latest version of ange-ftp should always be available for
anonymous FTP from
     alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu

in the file
     ange-ftp/ange-ftp.tar.Z

(which includes both `ange-ftp.el' and this texinfo file.) In ange-ftp
notation, that's
     /anonymous@alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu:ange-ftp/ange-ftp.tar.Z

   Alternatively, ange-ftp is also part of the Emacs-Lisp Archive on
`archive.cis.ohio-state.edu'. The latest version should always be
available on this site, but the Lisp-Code Directory entry is not always
up to date; it currently reads:
     ange-ftp (3.112)  91-08-12
      Andy Norman, <ange@hplb.hpl.hp.com>
      archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:
        /pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/as-is/ange-ftp.el.Z
     transparent FTP Support for GNU Emacs

   Ange-ftp can also be found at:
     ugle.unit.no:/pub/gnu/emacs-lisp/ange-ftp.el.Z

   Failing these, someone on the ange-ftp mailing list (*Note Getting
help::) or the author himself (*Note What is ange-ftp?::) may be able to
help you find the latest version.

   If you intend to do a lot of browsing though archive sites it is
definitely worth your while installing Sebastian Kremer's Tree Dired
along with ange-ftp (if you haven't done it already). Tree Dired will
work with ange-ftp without any modifications: all you need to do is
follow the installation instructions that come with the package. The
Tree Dired package comes complete with the latest version of ange-ftp,
and is available for anonymous FTP from the following sites:
     ftp.thp.Uni-Koeln.DE:/pub/gnu/emacs/diredall.tar.Z  (134.95.64.1)
     ftp.cs.buffalo.edu:pub/Emacs/diredall.tar.Z

Alternatively, you can get in touch with Sebastian himself using his
e-mail address: `sk@thp.Uni-Koeln.DE'.

Installing the source
=====================

   Installation is simply a matter of copying the file `ange-ftp.el' to
a directory in your load-path. If you don't already have a load-path,
this is probably a good time to make one. Just create a directory (say,
`~/elisp') in which you plan to keep your Emacs-Lisp files. Then place
the following line in your `.emacs':
     (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/elisp") load-path))

The `expand-file-name' is *important* -- omitting it is a common reason
why load-paths do not work.

   Once you've copied `ange-ftp.el' to the appropriate directory, it is
recommended to byte-compile it, with `M-x byte-compile-file'. Then
place the line
     (require 'ange-ftp)

in your `.emacs' (*after* the line which modifies your load-path, of
course!) It's that simple.

   The above instructions should allow you to access all hosts that your
local machine can access. If your local host has limited access,
however, you may wish to have ange-ftp working through a gateway
machine. If so, read on. Otherwise, *Note Using ange-ftp:: to get
started using ange-ftp.


File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: Using a gateway,  Next: Other options,  Prev: Installing source,  Up: Installing ange-ftp

Using a gateway
===============

   Suppose you are running Emacs (and ange-ftp, of course) on a machine
X (let's call it the `local host') and you want to access a file on a
machine Z (which we will call the `remote host'). Unfortunately, X does
not have FTP access to Z: when you try a manual FTP something like the
following happens:
     X$ ftp Z.foo.bar.com
     ftp: connect: Host is unreachable

However, X *does* have access to a machine Y (the `gateway machine')
which *can* access Z. Fortunately, you have an account on the gateway
machine, and so the solution is to login to Y, ftp to Z, download the
file you want from Z to Y, and then copy it from Y to the local host,
X. This can get a bit tedious, to say the least, but fortunately
ange-ftp can do all the hard work for you.

   Firstly, you need to set the variable `ange-ftp-gateway-host' to the
name of the gateway machine. The name should be the one that the local
host recognises, that is, the name you use with `login' so that it
works.
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-host "Y.local.lan.edu")

Since you only need to go through these convolutions for remote hosts
that the local host can't access directly, you can set the variable
`ange-ftp-local-host-regexp' to a regular expression which matches
those hostnames that X can access, but does not match those hosts that
only the gateway can access. In other words, if the host you are trying
to access matches `ange-ftp-local-host-regexp', the FTP process will be
run on the local machine, otherwise it will be run on the gateway
machine. For example
     (setq ange-ftp-local-host-regexp "\\.hp\\.com$\\|^[^.]*$")

will match all hosts that are in the `.hp.com' domain, or don't have an
explicit domain in their name, but will fail to match hosts with
explicit domains or that are specified by their IP address.

   The next step is to determine whether you have a smart gateway, that
is, if the FTP process on the gateway will accept commands of the form
`USER user@host'. You can test this by trying a manual FTP:
     X$ ftp -n Y.local.lan.edu
     Connected to Y.local.lan.edu
     220 Y.local.lan.edu FTP server (Version ?.??? some-date) ready.
     ftp> user myname@Z.foo.bar.com

If you then got a message like:
     331 Password required for myname@Z.foo.bar.com
     Password:
     530 Login incorrect.
     Login failed.

then you *don't* have a smart gateway. If you do, then something else
happens - but since it doesn't work for me I can't say what!  Anyway,
if you do have a smart gateway, put the line
     (setq ange-ftp-smart-gateway t)

in your `.emacs'. You may also wish to set the variable
`ange-ftp-smart-gateway-port' to the port of the gateway machine to use
when smart gateway is in operation, but the default of 21 will probably
be fine. In any case, your installation has finished, so *Note Using
ange-ftp:: now - the rest of this section is of no use to you. If on
the other hand you don't have a smart gateway, put the line
     (setq ange-ftp-smart-gateway nil) ; this is the default

in your `.emacs' and read on.

   Since to get files from Z to X we need to copy from Z to Y, and then
from Y to X, we need a place to store files on Y which is also
accessible by X, i.e. we need a directory which is mounted on both X and
Y. Since we are assuming that the local host and the gateway machine are
on the same local network, it's fairly likely that this is the case
thanks to NFS.  If such a directory exists, then ange-ftp can transfer
files from Z to X simply by FTP'ing from Z to the temporary directory
on Y, and then using a normal (local) copy from the image of the
temporary directory on X to the destination directory. Unfortunately,
ange-ftp requires that this temporary directory has the *same* name on
both the local and gateway machines, so you might need to do some
twiddling with symbolic links, or ask your sysadmin to set something up
with NFS. Once you have found such a directory, set the variable
`ange-ftp-gateway-tmp-name-template' to the name of this directory plus
an identifying filename prefix. For example:
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-tmp-name-template "/nfs/hplose/ange/ange-ftp")

where `/nfs/hplose/ange' is a directory that is shared between the
gateway machine Y and the local machine X.

   The next step is to find a means of getting an FTP process running on
the gateway machine. The simplest method is to spawn a remote shell
using `remsh' or `rsh' or their equivalent. Unfortunately, this doesn't
always work -- try the following:
     X$ rsh Y.local.lan.edu ftp

On my system, this command simply hangs. On others, it might be
disallowed for security reasons. If it doesn't work for you, then skip
the rest of this paragraph. If it does, then you should set then
variable `ange-ftp-gateway-program' to the name of the program used to
spawn a remote shell. The default is `"remsh"' on HP-UX machines, and
`"rsh"' otherwise. You should also set
`ange-ftp-gateway-program-interactive' to `nil':
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-program "rsh")
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-program-interactive nil)

and now your installation is complete.

   Since spawning a remote shell didn't work, ange-ftp needs to actually
login to the gateway machine to run ftp, the same as you would do if you
were running ftp manually. So you need to set the variable
`ange-ftp-gateway-program' to the name of the program that lets you log
onto the gateway machine -- probably `"rlogin"' or `"telnet"':
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-program "rlogin")

Now set the variable `ange-ftp-gateway-prompt-pattern' to a regular
expression that matches the prompt you get when you login to the gateway
machine.  Be very specific here; this regexp must not match *anything*
in your login banner except this prompt.  `shell-prompt-pattern' is far
too general as it appears to match some login banners from Sun
machines. For example:
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-prompt-pattern "^[^$]*\\$ *")

You also need to set the variable `ange-ftp-gateway-program-interactive'
to `t' to let ange-ftp know that it has to "hand-hold" the login to the
gateway machine:
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-program-interactive t)

Now comes a slightly tricky bit. You need to set the variable
`ange-ftp-gateway-setup-term-command' to a UNIX command that will put
the pty connected to the gateway machine into a no-echoing mode, and
will strip off carriage-returns from output from the gateway machine.
The default is `"stty -onlcr -echo\n"' for HP-UX machines, and `"stty
-echo nl\n"' otherwise. So
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-setup-term-command "stty -echo nl\n")

will probably work. If it does, then you're done.  There's a bit of a
problem for `tcsh' users, though: in some versions of `tcsh', the "tty
sanity checking" feature prevents the above commands from working. In
this case, an easy fix is to invoke `csh' first, and then run the
`stty':
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-setup-term-command  "exec csh\nstty -echo nl\n")
   or maybe
     (setq ange-ftp-gateway-setup-term-command  "(stty -echo nl; csh)\n")

may well do the trick. When using this method, synchronisation may be a
problem: if your gateway machine is slow in responding, when ange-ftp is
ready for (and indeed has already sent) FTP commands, your machine may
still be setting up. This can cause ange-ftp to think that the FTP has
had an error, and abort. One solution is to set `ange-ftp-skip-msgs' (a
regular expression matching messages from the ftp process that can be
ignored) so that any line ending in `^M' (carriage-returns) will be
ignored (since the `stty' hasn't come into effect yet) and also to
ignore any lines beginning with your prompt (since this means the
terminal setup is still in progress):
     (setq ange-ftp-skip-msgs
       (concat "\\|^.*\C-M$\\|" ange-ftp-gateway-prompt-pattern
                                                   ange-ftp-skip-msgs))

Unfortunately, this can also mean that sometimes ange-ftp won't
recognise a *real* error, and simply hang - but if that ever happens
`C-g' might get you out of it.

Other user options
==================

   Here are the other user options available in ange-ftp:

   `ange-ftp-netrc-filename': The name of a file in `netrc(5)' format
that ange-ftp will use to match hostnames, users and their respective
passwords.  Hostnames specified here are also used for hostname
completion.  The default is `"~/.netrc"'.

   `ange-ftp-default-user': If this is a string, it is the username to
use when none is specified in a filename. If `nil', then the name under
which the user is logged in is used. If non-`nil' but not a string, the
user is prompted for the name. The default is `nil'.

   `ange-ftp-default-password': The password to use when the user is the
same as `ange-ftp-default-user'. The default is `nil'.

   `ange-ftp-default-account': Account password to use when the user is
the same as `ange-ftp-default-user'. The default is `nil'.

   `ange-ftp-generate-anonymous-password': If this is `t', then
ange-ftp will generate a password of the form `your_username@local_host'
when you specify a username of `anonymous' in the filename (or if you
are automatically logged in as `anonymous'). If this is a string, then
that string is used instead. If it is `nil', then the user is prompted
for a password. The default is `nil'.

   `ange-ftp-dumb-unix-host-regexp': The FTP servers on some machines
have problems if the `ls' command is used. The usual indication that
something is wrong is when ange-ftp erroneously thinks that a directory
is just a plain file. The routine `ange-ftp-add-dumb-unix-host' can can
be called to tell ange-ftp to limit itself to the `DIR' command and not
`ls' for a given host (but this change will take effect for the current
GNU Emacs session only). If a large number of machines with similar
hostnames have this problem then it is easier to change the value of
this variable to a regexp which matches hostnames which have this
problem, particularly since ange-ftp cannot automatically detect such
hosts. The default is `nil'.

   `ange-ftp-binary-file-name-regexp': By default ange-ftp will
transfer files in ASCII mode. If a file being transferred matches the
value of this regexp then the FTP process will be toggled into BINARY
mode before the transfer and back to ASCII mode after the transfer. The
default is:
     (concat "\\.Z$\\|\\.lzh$\\|\\.arc$\\|\\.zip$\\|\\.zoo$\\|\\.tar$\\|"
             "\\.dvi$\\|\\.ps$\\|\\.elc$\\|TAGS$\\|"
     	"\\.gif$\\|\\.EXE\\(;[0-9]+\\)?$")

   `ange-ftp-hash-mark-size': Ange-ftp by default requests that the FTP
process sends hash marks (just `#' characters) during transfers to keep
track of how much data has been sent or received. This variable, if
non-`nil', should be the number of kilobytes represented by the FTP
client's hash mark. The default value of 1 doesn't work for me -- I use
2 instead.

   `ange-ftp-process-verbose': If this is `t' then ange-ftp will be
chatty about interaction with the FTP process. The default is `t'.

   `ange-ftp-ftp-program-name': This should be the name of the FTP
program to run on the local host. The default value of `"ftp"' should
be fine for most systems.

   `ange-ftp-gateway-ftp-program-name': Same as above, but this time
it's the name of the program to be used if a gateway is in use. The
default is again `"ftp"', but some AT&T folks claim to use something
called `"pftp"' here.

   `ange-ftp-make-backup-files': A list of operating systems for which
ange-ftp will make Emacs backup files on the remote host. For example,
`'(unix)' makes sense, but `'(unix vms)' or `'(vms)' would be silly,
since VMS makes its own backups.  The host type is determined by the
function `ange-ftp-host-type'.  Possible host types are: `dumb-unix';
`vos'; `vms'; `mts'; and `unix'. The default of `nil' means make no
backups on remote hosts.

   `ange-ftp-path-format': This variable dictates the the format of a
fully expanded remote pathname. This is a cons `(REGEXP . (HOST USER
PATH))', where `REGEXP' is a regular expression matching the full
remote pathname, and `HOST', `USER', and `PATH' are the numbers of
parenthesised expressions in `REGEXP' for the components (in that
order). The syntax can be customised with this variable to a certain
extent, but there are limitations. The default is
`'("^/\\(\\([^@/:]*\\)@\\)?\\([^@/:]*\\):\\(.*\\)" . (3 2 4))'.

   `ange-ftp-multi-msgs': A regular expression matching messages from
the ftp process that start a multiline reply. The default is
`"^220-\\|^230-\\|^226\\|^25.-\\|^221-\\|^200-\\|^530-\\|^4[25]1-"'

   `ange-ftp-good-msgs': A regular expression matching messages from
the ftp process that indicate that the action that was initiated has
completed successfully. The default is `"^220 \\|^230 \\|^226\\|^25.
\\|^221 \\|^200 \\|^[Hh]ash mark"'.

   `ange-ftp-skip-msgs': A regular expression matching messages from
the ftp process that can be ignored. The default is
     (concat "^200 \\(PORT\\|Port\\) \\|^331 \\|^150 \\|^350 \\|^[0-9]+ bytes \\|"
             "^Connected \\|^$\\|^Remote system\\|^Using\\|^ \\|Password:\\|"
             "^local:\\|^Trying\\|^125 \\|^550-")

but you might need to tweak it if ange-ftp is giving up when it
shouldn't.

   `ange-ftp-fatal-msgs': A regular expression matching messages from
the FTP process that indicate something has gone drastically wrong
attempting the action that was initiated and that the FTP process should
(or already has) been killed. The default is
     (concat "^ftp: \\|^Not connected\\|^530 \\|^4[25]1 \\|rcmd: \\|"
             "^No control connection\\|unknown host\\|^lost connection")

   `ange-ftp-gateway-fatal-msgs': Regular expression matching messages
from the rlogin / telnet process that indicates that logging in to the
gateway machine has gone wrong. The default is
     "No route to host\\|Connection closed\\|No such host\\|Login incorrect"

   `ange-ftp-tmp-name-template': This should be a directory and a
filename prefix indicating where ange-ftp should make temporary files.
The default of `"/tmp/ange-ftp"' should be fine for most systems.

   `ange-ftp-retry-time': Number of seconds to wait before retrying if
a file or listing doesn't arrive. For slow connections, you might get a
"listing unreadable" error messages or an empty buffer for a file that
you know has something in it.  The solution is to increase the value of
`ange-ftp-retry-time'.  Its default value is 5 which is plenty for
reasonable connections.  However, for some transatlantic connections 20
might be a better value.

Using ange-ftp
**************

   Once you have ange-ftp installed, you never need worry about using
FTP again. The interface is completely transparent, and you may now use
Emacs commands such as `C-x C-f' (`find-file') on *any* file that your
local host (or, if you are using one) your gateway can access. That
file may be a regular file (for editing, viewing etc.), a directory
(for invoking Dired) or even a symbolic link (pointing to a directory
or a regular file). All it takes is an extended filename syntax. For
example, if you give the filename
     /ange@anorman:/tmp/notes

to `find-file', then ange-ftp will spawn an FTP process, connect to the
host `anorman' as user `ange', get the file `/tmp/notes' and pop up a
buffer containing the contents of that file as if it were on the local
filesystem.  If ange-ftp needed a password to connect then it would
prompt the user in the minibuffer.  From then on you can edit that file
as if it were any other file: saving is with `C-x C-s' as usual -- in
fact, everything is as usual.

   Ange-ftp is also extremely useful for regular "file-transfer" FTP
jobs.  Since Dired also works on remote directories when using
ange-ftp, you will be able to browse the filesystem on your favourite
archive site with consummate ease.

File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: Remote filenames,  Next: Using Dired,  Up: Using ange-ftp

Remote filename syntax
======================

   The general form of the extended filename syntax is
     /user@host:path

which refers to the file pointed to by `path' on machine `host' when
logging in as user `user'. When `path' is supplied as a relative
file-name (that is, without a leading `/') it is relative to `user''s
home directory (although such relative filenames are ultimately
converted to absolute ange-ftp pathnames). You may even refer to home
directories of users on remote Unix sites using the standard tilde `~'
notation.  `host' needs to be the fully qualified pathname if the local
or gateway machine requires it to be (however hostname completion is
available if it is included in your `.netrc' - *Note Using a .netrc::),
or it may be an IP number if your nameserver can't find the site. The
`user@' part may be omitted, in which case the username is chosen on
the basis of the variable `ange-ftp-default-user' (*Note Other
options::) and your `.netrc'. If a password is requested by the FTP
process, ange-ftp will either prompt you for it, or generate one on the
basis of the variables `ange-ftp-default-password', and your `.netrc'.

   Thus the following are all valid ange-ftp filenames:
     /anonymous@waldo.uranium.com:pub/games/wumpus
     /root@127.44.3.1:/etc/passwd
     /jbrown@freddie.ucla.edu:~mblack/
     /alpha.gnu.ai.mit.edu:ange-ftp/ange-ftp.tar.Z

Using Dired
===========

   This feature of ange-ftp is particularly useful when file-transfers,
as opposed to file-editing, are the order of the day. Simply run
`find-file' on a directory to get a listing of the files in that
directory. For example, you might run `find-file' on
     /anonymous@archive.site.com:pub

to see what's in the `pub' directory of your favourite archive site.
This brings up a Dired buffer of all the files in that directory.  The
`f' command is useful for looking at `README' files -- if you then
decide to save it `C-x C-w' is useful. You can also use this method to
copy files, but the `c' command is easier. The `f' command can also be
used to descend the directory tree by applying it to directories.

   You can also use Dired to refresh ange-ftp's internal cache. If you
(or anybody else) has changed a remote directory since you first
accessed it with ange-ftp, completion is not provided on any new files
that ange-ftp does not know about. If you have (or create) a Dired
buffer which contains the modified directory, executing `revert-buffer'
with a prefix argument (`C-u g' in the Dired buffer) will force a
refresh of both the the buffer *and also ange-ftp's internal cache*. If
you find that filename completion isn't working on a file that you
*know* is there, this is how to fix the problem.

   The version of Dired supplied with Emacs version 18.58 (and earlier
versions) does not include a capability for multiple file transfers. The
Tree Dired package (*Note Obtaining source code::), however, is ideal
for this application. Tree Dired provides facilities for maintaining an
entire directory tree in a Dired buffer, for marking files which match a
certain regexp (or you can select files interactively) and then copying
all those files to your local host (or even a different remote host).
Another useful feature is Virtual Dired, which allows you to save Dired
buffers of remote hosts, allowing you to browse them at a later date
without actually needing to connect to the host. See the documentation
for Tree Dired for more details.

   Since ange-ftp is mostly transparent, modifying Dired or Tree Dired
by means of hooks or keybindings should still work.

Using a .netrc file
===================

   Being prompted for passwords all the time can get rather annoying,
but there is a way to fix the problem -- a `.netrc' (but *Note Other
options:: and `ange-ftp-netrc-filename' if you want another filename)
file in your home directory. Basically, this is a file (in the format
of Unix `netrc(5)') which contains the names of all the machines you
regularly login to, as well as the username and password you use for
that machine. You can also supply an account password, if required.

   Your `.netrc' file consists of lines of the form
     machine <machine-name> login <user-name> password <password>

It doesn't all have to be on the one line, though: any `login' or
`password' commands in the file refer to the previous `machine'
command. You can also have `account <account-passwd>' commands if you
need special account passwords.

   For example, you might have the following line in your `.netrc':
     machine Y.local.lan.edu login myname password secret

Then if you run `find-file' on the file `/Y.local.lan.edu:somefile' you
will automatically be logged in as user `myname' with password
`secret'. You can still login under another name and password, if you
so desire: just include the `user@' part of the filename.

   You may also include a default option, as follows:
     default login <user-name> password <password>

which applies to any other machines not mentioned elsewhere in your
`.netrc'. A particularly useful application of this is with anonymous
logins:
     default login myname password myname@myhost.edu

so that accessing `/anyhost:anyfile' will automatically log you in
anonymously, provided the host is not mentioned in the `.netrc'.  Note
also that if the value of `ange-ftp-default-user' is non-`nil', its
value will have precedence over the username supplied in the default
option of the `.netrc'.

   The `.netrc' file is also useful in another regard: machines
included in it are provided with hostname completion. That is, for any
machine in the `.netrc', you need only type a slash and the first few
characters of its name and then press TAB to be logged in automatically
with a username and password from the `.netrc' file.  So it's a good
idea to put hosts you use regularly in your `.netrc' as well:
     machine archive.site.com login anonymous password myname@X.local.lan.edu

Ange-ftp commands
=================

   Ange-ftp supplies a few interactive commands to make connecting with
hosts a little easier.

Command `ange-ftp-set-user': Prompts for a hostname and a username.
Next time access to the host is attempted, ange-ftp will attempt to log
in again with the new username.

Command `ange-ftp-set-passwd': Prompts for a hostname, user and
password. Future logins to that host as that user will use the given
password.

Command `ange-ftp-set-account': Prompts for a hostname, user and
account. Future logins to that host as that user will use the given
account.

   Note that the effects of the above three commands only last the
duration of the current Emacs session. To make their effects permanent,
you may include them as lisp code in your `.emacs':
     (ange-ftp-set-user HOST USER)
     (ange-ftp-set-password HOST USER PASSWORD)
     (ange-ftp-set-account HOST USER ACCOUNT)

This is an alternative to using a `.netrc'; *Note Using a .netrc::.

Command `ange-ftp-kill-ftp-process': kill the FTP process associated
with a given buffer's filename (by default the current buffer). This is
an easy way to achieve a resynch: any future accesses to the remote
host will cause the FTP process to be recreated.

Descriptive directory listings
==============================

   Some hosts (such as `cs.uwp.edu') now use descriptive directory
listings (which in fact contain *less* information than the standard
listing!) when issued the `ls' command, and ange-ftp has been modified
to cope with this. Ange-ftp can detect such listings, but if you
regularly use a remote host which uses this extended listing format you
should set the variable `ange-ftp-dl-dir-regexp' to a regular
expression which matches directories using the extended listing format.
You shouldn't anchor the regexp with `$' - that way the regexp will
match subdirectories as well.  Alternatively, you can use the
interactive command `ange-ftp-add-dl-dir' to temporarily add a remote
directory for this Emacs session only.

   Tree Dired has been modified to work with such descriptive listings.


File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: Non-Unix Hosts,  Next: Completion,  Prev: DL support,  Up: Using ange-ftp

Using ange-ftp with non-Unix hosts
==================================

   Ange-ftp also works with some non-Unix hosts, although not
necessarily with all the features available with Unix hosts. VMS, CMS,
and MTS systems will all now work with ange-ftp and Tree Dired (although
Classical Dired may well be broken on such systems.) Filename completion
also now works on these hosts.

   Ange-ftp should be able to automatically detect which type of host
you are using (VMS, CMS or MTS), but if it is unable to do so you can
fix the problem by setting the appropriate `ange-ftp-TYPE-host-regexp'
variable (where `TYPE' is one of `vms', `cms' or `mts') - see below. If
ange-ftp is unable to automatically detect any VMS, CMS or MTS host,
please report this as a bug: *Note Bugs::.

   In all cases the file-name conventions of the remote host are
converted to a UNIX-ish format, and this is the format you should use
to find files on such hosts.

File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: VMS support,  Next: CMS support,  Up: Non-Unix Hosts

VMS support
-----------

   VMS filenames are of the form `FILE.TYPE;##', where both `FILE' and
`TYPE' can be up to 39 characters long, and `##' is an integer version
number between 1 and 32,767. Valid characters in filenames are `A'-`Z',
`0'-`9', `_', `-' and `$', however `$' cannot begin a filename and `-'
cannot be used as the first or last character.

   Directories in VMS are converted to the standard UNIX `/' notation.
For example, the VMS filename
     PUB$:[ANONYMOUS.SDSCPUB.NEXT]README.TXT;1
   would be entered as

     /PUB$$:/ANONYMOUS/SDSCPUB/NEXT/README.TXT;1

(The double `$' is required to prevent Emacs from attempting to expand
an environment variable.)  Similarly, to anonymously FTP the file
`[.CSV.POLICY]RULES.MEM;1' from `ymir.claremont.edu' you would type
`C-x C-f /anonymous@ymir.claremont.edu:CSV/POLICY/RULES.MEM;1'. You can
always drop off the `;##' part at the end of the filename to get the
latest version.

   Sandy Rutherford provides some tips for using VMS hosts:
   * Although VMS is not case sensitive, EMACS running under UNIX is.
     Therefore, to access a VMS file, you must enter the filename with
     upper case letters.

   * To access the latest version of file under VMS, you use the
     filename without the `;' and version number. You should always
     edit the latest version of a file. If you want to edit an earlier
     version, copy it to a new file first. This has nothing to do with
     ange-ftp, but is simply good VMS operating practice. Therefore, to
     edit `FILE.TXT;3' (say 3 is latest version), do `C-x C-f
     /ymir.claremont.edu:FILE.TXT'. If you inadvertently do
          `C-x C-f /ymir.claremont.edu:FILE.TXT;3'

     you will find that VMS will not allow you to save the file because
     it will refuse to overwrite `FILE.TXT;3', but instead will want to
     create `FILE.TXT;4', and attach the buffer to this file. To get
     out of this situation, `M-x write-file
     /ymir.claremont.edu:FILE.TXT' will attach the buffer to latest
     version of the file. For this reason, in Tree Dired `f'
     (`dired-find-file'), always loads the file sans version, whereas
     `v', (`dired-view-file'), always loads the explicit version
     number. The reasoning being that it reasonable to view old
     versions of a file, but not to edit them.

   * VMS filenames often contain `$' characters: make sure you always
     quote these as `$$' and watch out for the Emacs bug which fails to
     quote `$''s when defaults are presented in the minibuffer: see
     *Note Bugs::.

   Ange-ftp should automatically detect that you are using a VMS host.
If it fails to do so (which should be reported as a bug) you can use the
command `ange-ftp-add-vms-host' to inform ange-ftp manually. For a more
permanent effect, or if you use a VMS host regularly, it's a good idea
to set `ange-ftp-vms-host-regexp' to a regular expression matching that
host's name. For instance, if use use `ymir.claremont.edu' a lot, place
the following in your .emacs:
     (setq ange-ftp-vms-host-regexp "^ymir.claremont.edu$")


File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: CMS support,  Next: MTS support,  Prev: VMS support,  Up: Non-Unix Hosts

CMS support
-----------

   Ange-ftp has full support, including Tree Dired support, for hosts
running CMS.

   CMS filenames are entered in a UNIX-y way. Minidisks are treated as
UNIX directories; for example to access the file `READ.ME' in minidisk
`*.311' on `cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu', you would enter
     /anonymous@cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu:/*.311/READ.ME
   If `*.301' is the default minidisk for this account, you could access
`FOO.BAR' on this minidisk as
     /anonymous@cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu:FOO.BAR
   CMS filenames are of the form `FILE.TYPE', where both `FILE' and
`TYPE' can be up to 8 characters. Again, beware that CMS filenames are
always upper case, and hence must be entered as such.

   Sandy Rutherford provides some tips on using CMS hosts:
   * CMS machines, with the exception of anonymous accounts, nearly
     always need an account password. To have ange-ftp send an account
     password, you can either include it in your `.netrc' (*Note Using
     a .netrc::), or use `ange-ftp-set-account'.

   * Ange-ftp cannot send "write passwords" for a minidisk. Hopefully,
     we can fix this.

   Ange-ftp should automatically detect that you are using a CMS host.
If it fails to do so (which should be reported as a bug) you can use the
command `ange-ftp-add-cms-host' to inform ange-ftp manually. For a more
permanent effect, or if you use a CMS host regularly, it's a good idea
to set `ange-ftp-cms-host-regexp' to a regular expression matching that
host's name.


File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: MTS support,  Prev: CMS support,  Up: Non-Unix Hosts

MTS support
-----------

   Ange-ftp has full support, including Tree Dired support, for hosts
running the Michigan terminal system, and should be able to
automatically recognise any MTS machine.

   MTS filenames are entered in a UNIX-y way. For example, if your
account was `YYYY', the file `FILE' in the account `XXXX:' on
`mtsg.ubc.ca' would be entered as
     /YYYY@mtsg.ubc.ca:/XXXX:/FILE
   In other words, MTS accounts are treated as UNIX directories. Of
course, to access a file in another account, you must have access
permission for it.  If `FILE' were in your own account, then you could
enter it in a relative path fashion as
     /YYYY@mtsg.ubc.ca:FILE
   MTS filenames can be up to 12 characters. Like UNIX, the structure
of the filename does not contain a type (i.e. it can have as many `.''s
as you like.) MTS filenames are always in upper case, and hence be sure
to enter them as such! MTS is not case sensitive, but an EMACS running
under UNIX is.

   Ange-ftp should automatically detect that you are using an MTS host.
If it fails to do so (which should be reported as a bug) you can use the
command `ange-ftp-add-mts-host' to inform ange-ftp manually. For a more
permanent effect, or if you use an MTS host regularly, it's a good idea
to set `ange-ftp-mts-host-regexp' to a regular expression matching that
host's name.


File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: Completion,  Next: Accessing the FTP process,  Prev: Non-Unix Hosts,  Up: Using ange-ftp

File- and host-name completion
==============================

   Full filename completion is supported on all remote UNIX hosts and
some non-Unix hosts.  Hostnames also have completion if they are
mentioned in the `.netrc' and no username is specified. However using
the filename completion feature can be a bit of a two edged sword.

   To understand why, we need to discuss how ange-ftp works. Whenever
ange-ftp is asked to find a remote file (or directory) an `ls' command
is sent to the FTP process to list all the files in the directory. This
list is maintained in an internal cache, to provide filename completion
for later requests on that directory. Ange-ftp keeps this cache
up-to-date by monitoring Emacs commands which affect files and
directories, but if a process outside Emacs (such as another user)
changes a directory (e.g. a new file is added) completion won't work on
that file since ange-ftp doesn't know about it yet. The solution if to
force ange-ftp to reread the directory and update it's cache, and the
easiest way to do that is with Dired -- *Note Using Dired:: to see how.

   Another problem is that the `ls' command can take a long time,
especially when dealing with distant hosts over slow links. So if you're
after a file in the `pub/images' directory but nothing else, it's a
better idea to type `pub/images/file TAB' than `pub/im TAB' which will
force a read of the `pub' directory (since ange-ftp needs to know how
to complete `im'). A little extra typing can often save a lot of
waiting. Don't be afraid to use the TAB key once the directory is
cached, though.


File: ange-ftp.info,  Node: Accessing the FTP process,  Prev: Completion,  Up: Using ange-ftp

Accessing the FTP process buffer
================================

   The FTP process used to access the remote files is available for
access if you wish. It will be in a buffer called `"*ftp
REMOTE-FILE-NAME*"', i.e. if you found the file
     /anonymous@archive.site.com:pub/README

there will be a buffer
     *ftp anonymous@archive.site.com*

where all the transfers are taking place. You can have a look at the
buffer using `C-x b' as usual, and even type in commands to the FTP
process under an interface very much like `shell-mode'. There are two
instances when doing this can be very useful: one is accessing non-UNIX
hosts, where Dired and filename completion may not work (if ange-ftp
even works at all). The other is multiple (i.e. wildcard) file transfers
which the standard version of Dired does not handle (but Tree Dired
*does*, and is worth installing for this feature alone.)  If you are
going to use `mget' or `mput', make sure you type `glob' first:
ange-ftp turns globbing off by default. Don't be afraid of changing
directories, either -- ange-ftp always uses absolute pathnames when
communicating with the FTP process.

   You can kill the FTP process at any time simply by killing this
buffer.  This won't cause ange-ftp any grief whatsoever -- if you later
make another request to that host, ange-ftp will simply fire up another
process and create a new buffer to hold it.

Bugs and Wish List
******************

   Here is a list of the known bugs in ange-ftp:

   * Be warned that files created by using ange-ftp will take account
     of the umask of the ftp daemon process rather than the umask of
     the creating user.  This is particulary important when logging in
     as the root user.  The way that I tighten up the ftp daemon's
     umask under HP-UX is to make sure that the umask is changed to 027
     before I spawn `/etc/inetd'.  I suspect that there is something
     similar on other systems.

   * Some combinations of FTP clients and servers break and get out of
     sync when asked to list a non-existent directory.  Some of the
     `ai.mit.edu' machines cause this problem for some FTP clients.

   * Ange-ftp does not check to make sure that when creating a new file,
     you provide a valid filename for the remote operating system.  If
     you do not, then the remote FTP server will most likely translate
     your filename in some way. This may cause ange-ftp to get confused
     about what exactly is the name of the file. The most common causes
     of this are using lower case filenames on systems which support
     only upper case, and using filenames which are too long.

   * Null (blank) passwords confuse both ange-ftp and some FTP daemons.

   * ange-ftp likes to use pty's to talk to its FTP processes. If GNU
     Emacs creates a FTP process that only talks via pipes (for
     example, if `process-connection-type' is `nil') then ange-ftp
     won't be getting the information it requires at the time that it
     wants it since pipes flush at different times to pty's. One
     disgusting way around this problem is to talk to the FTP process
     via rlogin which does the `right' things with pty's.

   * You need to quote `$' characters in filenames by using `$$'
     instead. This isn't actually a bug, but rather an Emacs convention
     (which allows environment variables in filenames.) What *is* an bug
     is that when filenames containing `$''s are inserted in the
     minibuffer as defaults, the `$' is not converted into the `$$'
     quoted form -- hopefully this will be fixed in version 19. It
     doesn't usually bother Unix users, but VMS filenames often contain
     `$'.  Incidentally, Sebastian Kremer's `gmhist' package (which
     comes with the Tree Dired distribution: *Note Obtaining source
     code::) fixes this bug.

   * Some hosts (notably ULTRIX) mark symbolic links with a `@'
     character in an `ls -F' listing. The variable
     `dired-ls-F-marks-symlinks' when set to `t' (the default) alerts
     Dired to this behaviour and everything is OK. Enabling this
     behaviour by default is not generally a problem on hosts which
     does *not* mark symlinks in this way, but if you have
     `dired-ls-F-marks-symlinks' set to `t' while accessing a such a
     host, then Dired will think that a symbolic link whose name ends
     in `@' (a strange thing indeed!) is a regular file. The fix (other
     than setting `dired-ls-F-marks-symlinks to' `nil', a bad idea if
     you regularly access hosts who mark symbolic links) is to remove
     `F' from the `ls' listing switches (use `C-u s' in the Dired
     buffer.)

     Another problem with symbolic links arises with hosts who do not
     show the linked file with `->' in the listing, meaning that Dired
     will not recognize the symlink. The solution here is to get a
     decent `ls' program on that machine.

   * No classic dired support for non-UNIX systems. Tree dired was
     enough.

   * If a directory listing is attempted for an empty directory on (at
     least some) VMS hosts, an ftp error is given. This is really an
     ftp bug, and I don't know how to get ange-ftp work to around it.

   * Bombs on filenames that start with a space. Deals well with
     filenames containing spaces, but beware that the remote ftpd may
     not like them much.

   * Doesn't autosave. Maybe someone could implement auto-saving on the
     local host ...

   * The code to do compression of files over ftp is not as careful as
     it should be. It deletes the old remote version of the file, before
     actually checking if the local to remote transfer of the
     compressed file succeeds. Of course to delete the original version
     of the file after transferring the compressed version back is also
     dangerous, because some OS's have severe restrictions on the
     length of filenames, and when the compressed version is copied
     back the `-Z' or `.Z' may be truncated. Then, ange-ftp would
     delete the only remaining version of the file. Maybe ange-ftp
     should make backups when it compresses files?

   * Remote to remote copying of files on non-Unix machines can be
     risky. Depending on the variable
     `ange-ftp-binary-file-name-regexp', ange-ftp will use binary mode
     for the copy. Between systems of different architecture, this still
     may not be enough to guarantee the integrity of binary files.
     Binary file transfers from VMS machines are particularly
     problematical.

   * Some CMS machines do not assign a default minidisk when you ftp
     them as anonymous. It is then necessary to guess a valid minidisk
     name, and `cd' to it.  This is (understandably) beyond ange-ftp;
     however Sebastian Kremer says:
          It is beyond ange-ftp, but if the `init' ftp macro were
          supported, one could write the appropriate `cd' command into
          that.  I used to do that on a CMS machine I had an account on
          because I never could remember the name of the minidisk.  I
          think I even had to give an `account' command, too.
          Supporting `init' would be a very handy thing.

          Hmm, why start `ftp(1)' with the `-n' flag at all?

   * For CMS support, we send too many `cd''s. Since `cd''s are cheap,
     I haven't worried about this too much. Eventually, we should have
     some caching of the current minidisk.

   If you find any bugs or problems with this package, *please* e-mail
