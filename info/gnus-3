Private Directory Specific Variables
====================================

`mhspool-list-directory-switches'

     Specifies switches for the function `mhspool-request-list' to pass
     to the command `ls' for getting file listings in a private
     directory.  There should be one entry for each line.  Its default
     value is `("-R")'.  Some machines may require the `("-R1")' switch.

Function Hooks
==============

`gnus-Group-mode-hook'

     Called with no arguments after initializing Group Mode if its value
     is non-`nil'.  This hook is intended to customize Group Mode only
     once.  It is possible to define or change the NNTP server as you
     like in this hook since the hook is called before GNUS is connected
     to an NNTP server.

`gnus-Subject-mode-hook'

     Called with no arguments after initializing Subject Mode if its
     value is non-`nil'.  This hook is intended to customize Subject
     Mode only once.  All sorts of searches in Subject Mode normally
     ignore the case of the text they are searching through.  If you do
     not want to ignore the case, set the variable `case-fold-search' to
     `nil' in this hook.

     The following example shows how to assign the functions
     `gnus-Subject-next-group' and `gnus-Subject-prev-group' to keys in
     Subject Mode.

          (setq gnus-Subject-mode-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (local-set-key "\C-cn" 'gnus-Subject-next-group)
                   (local-set-key "\C-cp" 'gnus-Subject-prev-group)))

`gnus-Article-mode-hook'

     Called with no arguments after initializing Article Mode if its
     value is non-`nil'.  This hook is intended to customize Article
     Mode only once.

     Displaying the current time in the mode line of buffers is disabled
     in the Article buffer and the Subject buffer to show information on
     the current newsgroup and the current article.  If you want to
     display the current time in the mode line of the Article buffer,
     make the variable `global-mode-string' no longer have a separate
     value in the buffer as follows:

          (setq gnus-Article-mode-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (kill-local-variable 'global-mode-string)))

`gnus-Kill-file-mode-hook'

     Called with no arguments after initializing KILL-File Mode if its
     value is non-`nil'.

`gnus-Browse-killed-mode-hook'

     Called with no arguments after initializing Browse-Killed Mode if its
     value is non-`nil'.

`gnus-Open-server-hook'

     Called with no arguments just before opening a connection to NNTP
     server if its value is non-`nil'.

`gnus-Startup-hook'

     Called with no arguments after an NNTP server is successfully
     connected to if its value is non-`nil'.  It is possible to change
     the behavior of GNUS according to the server.

`gnus-Group-prepare-hook'

     Called with no arguments after a list of newsgroups is prepared in the
     Newsgroup buffer.  This hook is intended to modify the buffer.

`gnus-Subject-prepare-hook'

     Called with no arguments after list of subjects is prepared in the
     Subject buffer.  This hook is intended to modify the buffer.

`gnus-Article-prepare-hook'

     Called with no arguments after an article is prepared in the Article
     buffer.  This hook is intended to modify the buffer.  For example, kanji
     code conversion or un-ROT13-ing can be done in this hook.

`gnus-Select-group-hook'

     Called with no arguments when a newsgroup is selected.  This hook is
     intended to change the behavior of GNUS according to the selected
     newsgroup.

     The following is an example of sorting the headers listed in the
     Subject buffer by date and then by subject.  Preceding `Re:' of
     subjects is ignored while comparing subjects.

          (setq gnus-Select-group-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   ;; First of all, sort by date.
                   (gnus-sort-headers
                    '(lambda (a b)
                       (gnus-date-lessp (gnus-header-date a)
                                        (gnus-header-date b))))
                   ;; Then sort by subject ignoring `Re:'.
                   (gnus-sort-headers
                    '(lambda (a b)
                       (gnus-string-lessp 
                        (gnus-simplify-subject
                         (gnus-header-subject a) 're-only)
                        (gnus-simplify-subject
                         (gnus-header-subject b) 're-only)
                        )))))

     The following is an example of simplifying subjects like the
     `gnus-Subject-next-same-subject' command does:

          (setq gnus-Select-group-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (mapcar (function
                            (lambda (header)
                              (nntp-set-header-subject
                               header
                               (gnus-simplify-subject
                                (gnus-header-subject header) 're-only))))
                           gnus-newsgroup-headers)))

     In some newsgroups, author names are meaningless.  It is possible to
     prevent listing author names in the Subject buffer as follows:

          (setq gnus-Select-group-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (cond ((string-equal "comp.sources.unix"
                                        gnus-newsgroup-name)
                          (setq gnus-optional-headers
                                (function gnus-optional-lines)))
                         (t
                          (setq gnus-optional-headers
                                (function
                                   gnus-optional-lines-and-from))))))

`gnus-Select-article-hook'

     Called with no arguments when an article is selected if its value
     is non-`nil'.

     The default hook definition shows conversation thread subtrees of the
     selected article automatically as follows:

          (setq gnus-Select-article-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (gnus-Subject-show-thread)))

     It is possible to run Rmail on a digest article automatically as
     follows:

          (setq gnus-Select-article-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (gnus-Subject-show-thread)
                   (cond ((string-equal "comp.sys.sun"
                                        gnus-newsgroup-name)
                          (gnus-Subject-rmail-digest))
                         ((and (string-equal "comp.text"
                                             gnus-newsgroup-name)
                               (string-match "^TeXhax Digest"
                                             (gnus-header-subject
                                                gnus-current-headers)))
                          (gnus-Subject-rmail-digest)
                          ))))

`gnus-Select-digest-hook'

     Called with no arguments when reading digest messages using Rmail
     if its value is non-`nil'.  This hook is intended to modify an
     article so that Rmail can work with it.  *Note Digest Articles::,
     for more information on digest articles.

     The following example is the default hook definition to modify
     incomplete digest articles:

          (setq gnus-Select-digest-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   ;; Reply-To: is required by
                   ;; `undigestify-rmail-message'.
                   (or (mail-position-on-field "Reply-to" t)
                       (progn
                         (mail-position-on-field "Reply-to")
                         (insert (gnus-fetch-field "From"))))))

`gnus-Rmail-digest-hook'

     Called with no arguments when reading digest messages using Rmail
     if its value is non-`nil'.  This hook is intended to customize
     Rmail Mode for reading digest articles.

`gnus-Apply-kill-hook'

     Called with no arguments when a newsgroup is selected and the
     Subject buffer is prepared if its value is non-`nil'.  This hook is
     intended to apply KILL files to the selected newsgroup.  It is set
     to the function `gnus-apply-kill-file' by default.

     Since a general KILL file is too heavy to use only for a few
     newsgroups, a lighter hook function is recommended.  For example,
     if you'd like to apply kills to articles which contain the string
     `rmgroup' in subject in newsgroup `control', you can use the
     following hook:

          (setq gnus-Apply-kill-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   (cond ((string-match "control" gnus-newsgroup-name)
                          (gnus-kill "Subject" "rmgroup")
                          (gnus-expunge "X")))))

     *Note KILL File::, for more information on KILL files.

`gnus-Mark-article-hook'

     Called with no arguments when an article is selected for the first
     time if its value is non-`nil'.  The hook is intended to mark an
     article as read (or unread) automatically when it is selected.

     The following example is the default definition of the hook:

          (setq gnus-Mark-article-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   ;; Mark the selected article as read.
                   (or (memq gnus-current-article gnus-newsgroup-marked)
                       (gnus-Subject-mark-as-read gnus-current-article))
                   ;; Put "+" on the current subject.
                   (gnus-Subject-set-current-mark "+")
                   ))

     It is possible to mark as unread (`-') instead when an article is
     selected as follows:

          (setq gnus-Mark-article-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   ;; Mark the selected article as unread.
                   (gnus-Subject-mark-as-unread gnus-current-article)
                   ;; Put "+" on the current subject.
                   (gnus-Subject-set-current-mark "+")
                   ))

`gnus-Inews-article-hook'

     Called with no arguments before posting an article if its value is
     non-`nil'.  This hook is called just before sending an article to
     the NNTP server or calling the `inews' program, while the hook
     `news-inews-hook' is called before preparing article headers.  This
     hook is intended to run special encoding programs such as kanji
     code conversion on the article.

`gnus-Exit-group-hook'

     Called with no arguments when exiting the current newsgroup if its
     value is non-`nil'.  If your machine is so slow that exiting from
     Subject Mode takes a long time, you can inhibit marking articles as
     read by using cross-reference information in the `Xref:' field by
     setting the variable `gnus-newsgroup-headers' to `nil' in this
     hook.

`gnus-Exit-gnus-hook'

     Called with no arguments when exiting GNUS if its value is
     non-`nil'.  If you want to clear out Emacs buffers which were
     created by GNUS and remain afterwards, you can use this hook.

     The following example shows how to kill a buffer which was used for
     posting news.

          (setq gnus-Exit-gnus-hook
                '(lambda ()
                   ;; Kill a buffer used for posting news.
                   (and (get-buffer "*post-news*")
                        (kill-buffer "*post-news*"))))

`gnus-Suspend-gnus-hook'

     Called with no arguments when suspending GNUS if its value is
     non-`nil'.  The purpose is the same as the hook
     `gnus-Exit-gnus-hook'.

`gnus-Save-newsrc-hook'

     Called with no arguments before saving the startup file `.newsrc'
     if its value is non-`nil'.  This hook is intended to change the way
     of backing up the startup file.

`nntp-server-hook'

     Called with no arguments when the connection between Emacs and the
     NNTP server is established if its value is non-`nil'.  This hook is
     intended to change the kanji code of a buffer associated with the
     stream.  Use the variable `nntp-server-name' to refer to the name
     of the NNTP server in this hook.  *Note Kanji Handling::, for more
     information.

NNTP Problems
=============

Infinite Loop Caused by Buggy Select Routine
--------------------------------------------

  Emacs may hang up while waiting for NNTP server responses.  This may
be caused by a buggy select routine of your operating system.  If so,
the problem may be solved by using source codes of `nntp.el' instead of
byte-compiled codes.  If you still have problems with it, set the
variable `nntp-buggy-select' to `t'.


Deadlock Caused by Packet Overflow
----------------------------------

  Emacs may hang up while retrieving headers of a large newsgroup.  The
reason is that too many requests have been sent to the NNTP server
without reading replies to them.  This causes a deadlock of Emacs and
the server.  In this case, the number of requests sent to the server at
one time must be reduced.  Set the variable `nntp-maximum-request' to a
lower value than the default.  The optimal value depends on your
computing environment.

Kanji Handling
==============

  Kanji handling scheme is different in each implementation of Japanese
GNU Emacs.  Moreover, in some case the scheme may be different in each
version of the same implementations.  Make sure which implementation and
version you are using.

Kanji Handling In NEmacs 2.1
----------------------------

  If the kanji code of articles stored in the NNTP server is different
from your private file kanji code, the correct kanji code of the buffer
associated with the NNTP stream must be specified using the hook
`nntp-server-hook' as follows:

     (setq nntp-server-hook
           '(lambda ()
              ;; Server's Kanji code is EUC (NEmacs hack).
              (make-local-variable 'kanji-fileio-code)
              (setq kanji-fileio-code 0)))

If you use a local news spool in stead of NNTP, the following additional
hook is required to post an article in the correct kanji code in any
case:

     (setq gnus-Inews-article-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (save-excursion
                (set-buffer nntp-server-buffer)
                (make-local-variable 'kanji-fileio-code)
                (setq kanji-fileio-code 0)   ;EUC
                )))

  The variable `nntp-server-name' is a buffer local variable holding a
host name running an NNTP server.  Use this variable to change the kanji
code according to the server.  The following example shows how to change
the kanji code using this variable.

     (setq nntp-server-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (make-local-variable 'kanji-fileio-code)
              (cond ((string-equal nntp-server-name "foo")
                     (setq kanji-fileio-code 0)) ;EUC
                    ((string-equal nntp-server-name "bar")
                     (setq kanji-fileio-code 1)) ;Shift-JIS
                    (t
                     (setq kanji-fileio-code 2)) ;JIS
                    )))

Kanji Handling In NEmacs 3.0
----------------------------

  The author has less experiences with NEmacs 3.0.  So, the following
description may be wrong.  If you find any mistakes, please let the
author know (*Note Reporting Bugs::).

  In NEmacs 3.0, the kanji code of articles stored in the NNTP server
must be specified according to both the service name (or number) and the
host name running the server.  For this, the function
`define-service-kanji-code' is provided.

  The following example specifies the kanji code of the host `flab' as
JIS using this function:

     (define-service-kanji-code "nntp" "flab" 2)      ;2 stands for JIS.


File: gnus  Node: SX/A Emacs, Prev: NEmacs3, Up: Kanji Handling

Kanji Handling In SX/A Emacs
----------------------------

  If the kanji code of articles stored in the NNTP server is not EUC, it
must be converted to EUC in an Emacs buffer after being read into the
buffer.  The kanji code of articles being posted must be also converted
to the server specific kanji code in an Emacs buffer before actually
being sent to the server.  The following examples show how to do these
using hooks:

     (setq gnus-Article-prepare-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                   "nkf" t t nil "-e" ;-e stands for EUC.
                                   )))
     (setq gnus-Inews-article-hook
           '(lambda ()
              (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max)
                                   "nkf" t t nil "-j" ;-j stands for JIS.
                                   )))

In this example, `nkf' (Network Kanji Filter) is used as a kanji code
converter, and the kanji code of the NNTP server is JIS.

Preloading GNUS
===============

  Basically, GNUS is not designed to be preloaded.  For instance, if you
preload `gnus.el', some user variables which are initialized from
environment variables may be improperly initialized according to your
environment definitions.  The variables `gnus-nntp-server',
`gnus-author-copy', and `gnus-article-save-directory' are such
variables.

  To prevent GNUS from being initialized from your definitions, you
should `unsetenv' related environment variables before preloading GNUS,
or set the variables to `nil' after loading GNUS.

info-gnus if you cannot read messages written in Japanese since most
discussions and important announcements will be sent to
info-gnus-english.


How to Report a Bug
===================

  If you find a bug, it is important to report it and to report it in a
way which is useful.  If it is a bug of a lisp program, what is the most
useful is an exact backtrace information of the lisp program with the
version number of GNUS that you are using.

  To make the backtrace information, you must set the Emacs variable
`debug-on-error' to `t' before the error happens.  A backtrace obtained
from a byte-compiled lisp program is not usually understandable.  To
make a human readable backtrace, load the source program which is not
byte-compiled yet and then produce the error.

  *Note Reporting Bugs: (emacs)Bugs, for more information.
